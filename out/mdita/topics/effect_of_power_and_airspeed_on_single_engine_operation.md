Effect of Power and Airspeed on Single Engine Operation
=======================================================

 {.body .conbody}
To fly safely on single engine you must know the effect of power on
rudder control at various airspeeds. This is vital to your safety when
practicing go-around procedures and other maneuvers that require quick
changes in power settings.

At 140 mph (CSE speed) directional control can be maintained with
takeoff power on the good engine. At airspeeds below 140 mph the plane
will turn into the dead engine if power is not reduced. When power is
reduced in accordance with the airspeed, directional control can be
maintained until normal stalling speeds are reached.

Practice this maneuver with the propeller unfeathered at a safe altitude
before attempting single engine landings. Perform this maneuver straight
ahead and in turns to the right and left. Practice from level flight and
in a simulation of a landing guide, with various degrees of flap
settings to determine limits at which a go-around may be made.

You may practice this maneuver with wheels and flaps up to determine its
characteristics, but, since this maneuver is used to practice for single
engine landings and go-arounds, perform it with wheels and flaps down
after its effect is determined.

With power set for normal climb reduce the airspeed below 140 mph until
the plane starts to turn toward the dead engine, even though you are
holding full opposite rudder.

**Recover by reducing power and lowering the nose.**

For practice, hold definite airspeeds (for example, 115 mph or 120 mph),
and add as much power as you can control.

This maneuver is excellent practice for single engine landings, and
go-around procedures. When the airspeed is below CSE speed you know how
much power you can safely add to prevent undershooting and to start a
go-around procedure.
