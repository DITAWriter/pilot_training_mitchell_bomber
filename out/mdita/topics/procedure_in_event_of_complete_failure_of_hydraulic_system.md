Procedure in Event of Complete Failure of Hydraulic System
==========================================================

 {.body .taskbody}
A checklist to follow if the hydraulic system on the [B-25]{.keyword}
fails.

 {.section .section .context}
In the event of complete failure of your landing gear hydraulic system,
operate the emergency controls as follows:


**Operation**

1.  [Establish effective interphone communication between the crew
    member operating the mechanism and the pilot.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Return to the home base if possible. Report your trouble to the
    tower.]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Climb to an altitude of at least 5000 feet above the surrounding
    terrain.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Reduce the airspeed below 150 mph (120-130 mph recommended.)]{.ph
    .cmd}
5.  [Place landing gear control handle in pilot\'s compartment
    \"DOWN.\"]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [Swing screw jack in radio compartment to the operating
    position.]{.ph .cmd}
7.  [Pull up-latch release and check to see that the main gear has
    released.]{.ph .cmd}
8.  [Operate the screw jack (clockwise) to lower the gear,]{.ph .cmd}
9.  [Use normal landing gear check to see that the gear is down and
    locked.]{.ph .cmd}
10. [Release the tension slightly on the screw jack after the gear is
    down and locked.]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
     {.note .warning .note_warning}
    [Warning:]{.note__title} Don\'t return this system to a stowed
    position until the plane is safely on the ground, with the landing
    gear locked to prevent its folding up.
    

    You must stow this system before the wheels can again be operated
    hydraulic ally.
    

**Nosewheel**

The lowering device for the nosewheel is in the navigator\'s
compartment, on the step into the pilot\'s compartment.

To operate:

11. [Pull nose gear release.]{.ph .cmd}
12. [Check to see that the gear has released.]{.ph .cmd}
13. [Turn the nosewheel pawl \"ON.\"]{.ph .cmd}
14. [Place crank on shaft, turn clockwise to lower.]{.ph .cmd}
15. [Check locked position normally after the gear is full down.]{.ph
    .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
     {.note .warning .note_warning}
    [Warning:]{.note__title} The nosewheel lowering cable operates every
    time the nosewheel is raised or lowered. It is engaged by the pawl
    to lower the wheels. If the pawl is accidently turned to \"ON\" the
    hydraulic system will tear the nose- wheel cable out of the plane.
    

    This pawl must be left \"ON\" after it is used until the plane is on
    the ground and braced against mishap.
