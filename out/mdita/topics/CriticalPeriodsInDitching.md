Critical periods in ditching
============================

 {.body .conbody}
There are two critical periods in ditching:

1.  The actual landing and handling of the airplane on the water. This
    is the sole responsibility of the pilot.
2.  The immediate abandonment of the airplane in an orderly manner after
    ditching. This requires the perfect coordination of the entire crew.
    Even in a training fuselage in a hangar, this cannot be done
    efficiently without a great deal of practice. After a severe shock
    with the fuselage rapidly filling with water, safe and speedy
    abandonment is impossible unless the drill has been painstakingly
    planned and practiced. Every crew member must know his job and the
    drill to the last detail. Many crews have saved themselves by
    carrying out a well- executed drill. **This required advance
    practice and a great deal of it.**
