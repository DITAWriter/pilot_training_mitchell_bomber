Prohibited Maneuvers in the [B-25]{.keyword}
============================================

 {.body .conbody}
The following maneuvers are not prohibited because of the flying
characteristics of the airplane, but because they impose severe
structural stresses on it. The [B-25]{.keyword} is a bomber, not a
pursuit plane.

The prohibited maneuvers in this airplane are:

-   Loops
-   Spins
-   Rolls
-   Vertical dives
-   Immelmanns
-   Inverted flight
-   Vertical banks

Those pilots who try to make a pursuit plane out of a bomber succeed
only in making a wreck of the bomber.

The maximum safe wingloading on the [B-25]{.keyword} when pulling out of
a dive is 3.67 G\'s, and then only at normal weight loadings or below.
The designed gross weight of the plane is 26,620 lb. The maximum
possible overload is 35,500 lb. Remember, however, that in present-day
military operations you seldom fty a mission under normal load
conditions. Almost all bombardment missions are overload flights.

The maximum diving speed of the [B-25]{.keyword} is 340 mph with normal
load weights. When the weight is 35,500 lb. the maximum speed is only
281 mph.

Know your airplane. The total flying time on the plane you are flying
may have reduced the safety factor the manufacturer built into it. Some
small trouble not (ound on the periodic inspections may show up in
violent maneuvers.

The pilot who flew the plane the previous day may have abused the
airplane, so conquer that urge to show off.
