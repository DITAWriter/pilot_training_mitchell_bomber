Conventional air-inflation de-icer boots are mounted on leading edges of
wings and empennage. A rotary distributor valve in the well of the
navigator\'s compartment furnishes air to the boots in a 5-phase cycle
every 40 seconds.

When the de-icer system is not in operation, suction provided by the
vacuum pumps on both engines prevents aerodynamic negative pressures
from raising the de-icer boots.

Operation of the surface de-icing system is automatic when the control
is turned \"ON.\"

There is a pressure gage for the de-icer system in the rear of the
navigator\'s compartment. This gage should read approximately 7 lb. sq.
in. under normal operating conditions. Should the pressure go above 10
lb. sq. in., the maximum pressure, immediately turn the control \"OFF\"
and check for the difficulty.

 {.note .caution .note_caution}
[CAUTION:]{.note__title} Do not operate the de-icer during landing or
takeoff. Never operate the de-icer system at speeds above 230 mph;
negative pressure on leading edge of wings will expand the de-icer
boots, causing them to rupture.
