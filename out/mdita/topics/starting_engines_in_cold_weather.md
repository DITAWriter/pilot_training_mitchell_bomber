Starting Engines in Cold Weather
================================

 {.body .taskbody}
A checklist to ensure that your engines will start and work properly in
cold weather conditions.

 {.section .section .context}
Make a normal start by following the procedure on the pilot\'s
checklist. If you have trouble starting the engines, take the following
supplementary measures:


1.  [Pull the props through about 15 blades before engaging the starter.
    The engines will need a lot of priming for a cold weather start. If
    possible use external power for cold weather starting.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [If the engine fails to start, check plugs for moisture. Make
    another attempt to start the engine when the plugs are dry,]{.ph
    .cmd}
3.  [Always make a normal start before using the oil dilution system.
    If, after the engines are running, your oil pressure is too high or
    is fluctuating and drops off when the rpm is increased, dilute the
    oil. (See dilution procedure under After Landing.)]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
     {.note .note .note_note}
    [Note:]{.note__title} Use this method only if time and extreme
    temperature conditions do not permit normal engine warm-up.
    
    

4.  [Do not run the engines at more than 1200 rpm until the oil has
    reached a temperature of 20Â°C.]{.ph .cmd}
5.  [If icing conditions exist, place carburetor air control handles in
    \"ICING\" until the induction system is free of ice.]{.ph .cmd}
