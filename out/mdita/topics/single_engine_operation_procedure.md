Single Engine Operation Procedure
=================================

 {.body .taskbody}
Critical single engine airspeed must be maintained at the sacrifice of
all other considerations.

1.  [Airspeed--- Maintain or get 140 mph by diving if necessary.]{.ph
    .cmd}
2.  [Directional control--- Obtain and hold directional control by using
    rudder.]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
    Slight aileron aids coordination but excessive use raises the
    stalling speed.
    Use the trim tabs to help you hold the plane if manual control is
    too difficult. Make these checks:
    

    a.  [Check your ignition switches.]{.ph .cmd}
    b.  [Check your fuel cut-off valves.]{.ph .cmd}
    c.  [Move mixture control to \"FULL RICH.\" ]{.ph .cmd}
    d.  [Turn the booster pumps \"ON.\" ]{.ph .cmd}

     {.itemgroup .info}

    ![Before you feather: ignition, fuel cut-off, mixture, booster
    pumps.](../images/single_eng_before_feather.png){#single_engine_operation_procedure__image_szw_kcp_3gb
    .image width="288"}\
    You can make these checks in far less time than it takes to read
    these lines; they may save the engine, and they prevent featheritis.
    

3.  [Increase power to the limit allowed by airspeed and rudder
    control--- Advance both prop controls and both throttles.]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
    It is sometimes difficult to tell which engine is out. As a
    precaution, apply power to both engines.
    

    A good method when you are not sure: If the plane wants to turn to
    the right, the right engine is dead; to the left, the left engine is
    dead. If you are on instruments, your bank-and-tum needle points to
    the dead engine.
4.  [Reduce drag. **Throttle back. Decrease rpm. or feather the prop.
    Mixture \"IDLE CUT-OFF\"** gear and flaps up, generators on---
    Feather the propeller by pushing the feathering button down.]{.ph
    .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .stepresult}
    The prop will feather, and when it does the button will return to
    normal position.
    

5.  [Close cowl flaps on dead engine.]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [Reduce fire hazard--- After the prop stops turning, cut off the
    fuel and ignition on that engine. Set the Lux system to the dead
    engine, and be prepared if a fire breaks out.]{.ph .cmd}
7.  [Trim--- Trim the plane for hands-off flight.]{.ph .cmd}

This may seem a complicated procedure; however, when you have practiced
it a few times, when you know exactly what you are going to do, the
entire procedure requires less than 10 seconds.
