Crosswind Landing
=================

 {.body .conbody}
Crosswind landing in the [B-25]{.keyword} requires accurate flying, to
save the plane from unnecessary structural stresses. You must land the
airplane smoothly to prevent blowing a tire, collapsing a struts or
exerting side loads on the gear.

There are three possible ways to land crosswind:

-   Hold the airplane straight and level toward the landing strip and
    drop one wing into the wind to counteract drift.
-   Crab into the wind to keep a straight ground path.
-   A combination of the two methods.

The third method is the best. Crab into the wind, then lower a wing.
This prevents you from dropping a wing too low or crabbing too much, and
it makes it easier to straighten out.

Any uncoordinated movement such as a slip raises the stalling speed. At
the speeds you must fly, a slip and the consequent stall spell disaster.

Once again, the secret of the landing is in the approach. Allow for
drift on the turn into the approach, and do not overshoot or undershoot
the approach leg. Correct for drift as soon as possible on the approach,
making a straight path to the landing strip.

If there is only a moderate wind, use full flaps; with a stronger wind,
use less flaps. If no flaps are used, a long ground roll will result. As
you begin to roundout for landing, bring up the low wing and straighten
the airplane so that there is no side load on the gear as it touches the
ground.

You may have to use fairly hard rudder pressure just before contact to
straighten the airplane properly.

After the plane is on the ground and has reached a three-point position,
there will be a tendency to weathervane into the wind. Hold a straight
course by lowering the downwind aileron and using the drag on that
aileron to counteract the weathervaning tendencies. The stronger the
crosswind, the greater the force exerted on the downwind aileron.

Use full rudder if necessary. As a last resort, make very cautious use
of the downwind brake and smooth use of the windward engine. Never blast
out roughly with the throttle, as this just aggravates the control of
the ship and strains the landing gear. Use of throttles increases the
length of roll considerably.

Where there is a strong drift, land on the upwind side of the runway.
The drift will carry you toward the center of the runway.

Common Errors {#common-errors .title .sectiontitle}
-------------

-   Failure to correct properly for drift when turning into the
    approach.
-   Failure to correct completely for drift, thereby turning onto the
    runway at an angle. This makes a good landing difficult or
    impossible.
-   Failure to recognize drift. This occurs frequently in moderate or
    slight crosswinds, although seldom where there is a runway to land
    on.
-   Failure to push the airplane straight on the actual landing, thus
    putting a side load on the gear. Avoid the tendency to straighten
    the plane out too high off the runway. If the plane stays in the air
    long enough it will drift off course and may land with one wheel off
    the runway.
