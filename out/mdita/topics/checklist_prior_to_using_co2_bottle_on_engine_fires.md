Checklist Prior to Using COâ‚‚ Bottle on Engine Fires
===================================================

 {.body .taskbody}
An immediate use of your CO~2~ bottle will only halt the fire
momentarily.

 {.section .section .context}
The danger of fire, other than the natural hazard of the flame, is that
the heat may melt or injure the control cables, wing spars, etc.

Do your best to combat engine fires, but don\'t stay with the ship so
long that an explosion traps you.

Don\'t use your CO~2~ bottle on an engine fire until:


1.  [Gasoline cut-off valves \"OFF.\"]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Prop at \"TNC. RPM\" to blow out the fire.]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Open the throttle.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Feather the prop when the fuel runs out.]{.ph .cmd}
5.  [Cut switches after prop stops turning.]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [Now, if you need it, use the CO~2~ bottle.]{.ph .cmd}
    a.  [Set selector switch to desired engine.]{.ph .cmd}
    b.  [Open the cowl flaps.]{.ph .cmd}
    c.  [Pull the handle. This discharges the CO~2~ on the flames.]{.ph
        .cmd}

     {.itemgroup .info}
     {.note .warning .note_warning}
    [Warning:]{.note__title} Warning: Don\'t under any circumstances try
    to restart the engine under these conditions. Your CO~2~ is
    exhausted and a recurrence of the fire will leave you with no
    defense at all.
