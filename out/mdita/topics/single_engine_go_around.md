Single Engine Go-Around
=======================

 {.body .taskbody}
Successful single engine go-around depends on an early decision that a
go-around is necessary. You can start a go-around procedure at a low
altitude and from a low airspeed on the approach, but it is difficult
and dangerous.

 {.section .section .context}
 {.note .important .note_important}
[Important:]{.note__title} Make your decision early.


The procedure is:


1.  [Maintain CSE speed at all times on the approach.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Apply normal climbing power, this will be sufficient if the
    procedure is started early on the approach.]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Reduce drag.]{.ph .cmd}
    a.  [Wheels up.]{.ph .cmd}
    b.  [Prop \"DEC. RPM\" (on bad engine).]{.ph .cmd}
    c.  [Flaps up to 15° until safe altitude and airspeed are
        obtained.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Trim the plane for hands-off flight.]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
    If you have to go around under emergency conditions, apply all the
    power you can hold without losing directional control.

     {.note .note .note_note}
    [Note:]{.note__title} Keep flaps ½ down when practicing this, since
    in emergency conditions the maneuver will start before you have
    lowered full flaps.
    

    If sufficient altitude is available, nose down to increase airspeed
    when power is applied to start a go-around.
