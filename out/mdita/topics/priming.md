Priming
=======

 {.body .conbody}
Priming is necessary to supply a sufficiently rich fuel air mixture to
the cylinder heads to facilitate starting of a cold motor.

Prime by operating the 3-position spring-loaded toggle switch on the
pilot\'s pedestal. This actuates the 2 primary active solenoids on the
carburetors.

For manual priming, press the small pin next to the solenoid on the
carburetor.

The primer allows fuel under pressure to pass through a valve and enter
the adapter section at 3 different points. On some late-model
carburetors no provision it, made for manual priming.
