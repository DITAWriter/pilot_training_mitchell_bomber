Chemical spray mission
======================

 {.body .taskbody}
Background and expectations on the chemical spray missions.

1.  [This is a chemical mission, using MR and FS.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [The plane will be equipped for the mission with a bomb bay chemical
    spray tank containing MR and two chemical wing tanks--- one on each
    wing--- containing FS.]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [The MR target for the mission will be the X Target. The FS target
    will be the Z target.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [The MR target is located approximately in the middle of the target
    area and is marked by an orange cross in its center.]{.ph .cmd}
5.  [Chemical tanks will be loaded into the plane. Plane will then be
    flown to the Z target, making an attack with FS, using one wing
    tank, from an altitude of 100 ft normally, with the intention of
    covering the center of the target with a screen of smoke.]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [The plane will then fly to X target, making an attack with MR from
    an altitude of 150 ft. after inspecting the field to see that the
    target is in place.]{.ph .cmd}
7.  [The plane will then return to Z target and release the second smoke
    screen from the remaining FS wing tank.]{.ph .cmd}
8.  [All crew members will be equipped with gas masks while in the
    performance of this mission. Copilot will wear gas mask beginning 30
    seconds before release of chemical until ship has been landed and
    brought to a stop.]{.ph .cmd}
9.  [This mission will not be flown when the wind velocity is greater
    than 20 mph.]{.ph .cmd}
10. [Magnetic course to X target, 197 degrees; distance 50 miles.]{.ph
    .cmd}
11. [Special attention should be given to direction of wind. Chemicals
    should be dropped from a flight path perpendicular to the wind.]{.ph
    .cmd}
12. [Mission will be flown at 500 feet above terrain. Towns along route
    will be avoided.]{.ph .cmd}
13. [The crew will be interrogated upon return to Home Base as to
    results of the mission.]{.ph .cmd}
