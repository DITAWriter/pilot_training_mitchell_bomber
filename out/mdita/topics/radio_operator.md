It is impossible to learn radio in a day.

There is a lot of radio equipment in today\'s [B-25]{.keyword} aircraft.
There is one particular man who is supposed to know all there is to know
about this equipment. Sometimes he does, but often he doesn\'t. His
deficiencies often do not become apparent until the crew is in the
combat zone when it is too late. Too often pilots and crows lose their
lives because the radio operator has accepted his responsibility
indifferently.

It is imperative that you check your radio operator\'s ability to handle
his job before taking him overseas as part of your crew. To do this you
may have to check with the various instructors to find out any weakness
in the radio operator\'s training and proficiency and to help overcome
such weaknesses.

The radio operator is required to:

1.  Render position reports every 30 minutes.
2.  Assist the navigator in taking fixes.
3.  Keep the liaison and command sets properly tuned and in good
    operating order.
4.  Understand from an operational point of view:
    a.  Instrument Landing
    b.  IFF
    c.  VHF
5.  Maintain a log.

In addition to being radio operator, the radio man is also a gunner.
During combat he leaves his watch at the radio and takes up his guns. He
often has to learn photography. Some of the best pictures taken in the
Southwest Pacific were taken by radio operators.
