Crosswind Takeoff
=================

 {.body .taskbody}
Modern flying, with its heavy airplanes, demands a runway for safe
operation. The days when you taxied out, lined up parallel to the wind
tee, and took off are gone forever.

 {.section .section .context}
Instead of 360 degrees of airfield available for takeoff, the modem
airfield has three runways, usually set to take advantage of the six
cardinal points of the prevailing winds. Using these runways, you
encounter cross winds of varying degrees and intensities.

The aids to a crosswind takeoff are the rudders, the throttles, the
aileron, and, as a last resort, the brakes.

The technique is:


1.  [Make the usual takeoff checks.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Advance the throttles, leading with the upwind throttle. The
    strength of the wind will determine the amount of lead.]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
    \
    ![](../images/takeoff_crosswind.png){.image width="288"}\
    

3.  [As the speed increases and the rudders become effective, equalize
    the throttles.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Leave the ground with the throttles evenly set and use just enough
    rudder and aileron to make a coordinated turn into the wind, thus
    counteracting any drift.]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
    \
    ![](../images/takeoff_crosswind_coord_turn.png){.image width="288"}\
     {.note .note .note_note}
    [Note:]{.note__title} The plane may skip as the speed increases
    toward the end of the takeoff roll. This is an indication that it is
    ready to fly. Help it along to prevent skipping and to keep the
    consequent side thrust from injuring the landing gear.

**Common Errors**

-   Failure to recognize the drift.
-   Trying to correct the drift by skidding instead of turning into the
    wind. This increases the stalling speed and if violent enough it
    will put the plane back on the ground. The bounce will be made with
    the drift applying a side thrust to the gear.
-   Juggling the throttles, giving uneven control. Lead the upwind
    throttle, constantly reducing the lead. As the speed increases the
    rudder control is great enough to take off cleanly.
