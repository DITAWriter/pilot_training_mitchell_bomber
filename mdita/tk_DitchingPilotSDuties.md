Ditching: Pilot\'s Duties
=========================

 {.body .taskbody}
Make the decision to ditch.

 {.section .section .context}
The rest of the crew must coordinate their duties with those of the
pilot. Crew members can practice their duties, and go through a drill,
each performing a defined action on a number called by the pilot. For
simplification these duties are listed in the order in which they should
be done.


1.  [Warn the crew by alarm bell--- this bell is attached to all
    positive leads on the plane. If either battery-disconnect is on and
    any current remains in the battery, it will operate. ]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Use the interphone--- get an acknowledgment from each crew member.
    ]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Turn IFF to \"EMERGENCY\"]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Check the fuselage tanks and bombs, and salvo if necessary. Close
    the bomb bay doors--- they must not be open for the landing.]{.ph
    .cmd}
5.  [Landing gear up--- check it! ]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [Get wind direction and velocity from navigator. ]{.ph .cmd}
7.  [Signal copilot to lower flaps as required. ]{.ph .cmd}
8.  [Notify crew to brace for the impact (interphone or bell). ]{.ph
    .cmd}
9.  [Cut mixture, cut switches just prior to landing. Leave
    battery-disconnect switches \"ON.\"]{.ph .cmd}
10. [Notify navigator to cut gas supply, unless gas cut-off switches are
    in the pilot\'s cockpit.]{.ph .cmd}
11. [Give alarm bell signal to abandon plane after landing.]{.ph .cmd}
