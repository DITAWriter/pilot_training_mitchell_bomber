Oil Dilution After Landing in Cold Weather
==========================================

 {.body .conbody}
To obtain sufficient dilution of the oil to facilitate starting, allow
the engine to cool either by idling or stopping after flight, before
dilution begins.

This will prevent rapid evaporation of the gasoline and insure that the
viscosity of the oil has been reduced sufficiently. In most cases you
will find that the engines have cooled sufficiently for dilution by the
time the airplane reaches the flight line.

Dilute the engines at 1000 rpm for the time indicated below, consistent
with the lowest expected air temperature.

 {.note .warning .note_warning}
[Warning:]{.note__title} Unreliable dilution occurs at these
temperatures if the oil tank is more than ¾ full.


At the completion of the above dilution period, run both engines up to
1700 rpm, continuing dilution, and with propellers in full \"INC. RPM\"
feather and un feather each propeller through one complete cycle.
Operate each propeller governor through one complete cycle. Release
dilution switch and decrease engine speed. Stop engines and install
engine covers.
