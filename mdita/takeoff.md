Takeoff
=======

 {.body .conbody}
Takeoff in the [B-25]{.keyword} with its tricycle gear, varies from that
with conventional gear only during the initial part of the roll. You
will find it much easier.

![Takeoff](../images/takeoff.png){#takeoff__image_ow1_jqm_cgb .image}

The principal difference is in attaining the proper angle of attack of
the wing. On the conventional type you start from a stall attitude and
reduce the angle to permit flight. In the [B-25]{.keyword} you start
from a negative angle of attack and increase the angle of attack by
raising the nosewheel.

Several factors affect the takeoff technique. Chief of these are gross
weight, wind velocity, type of runway, and the height and distance of
the nearest obstacles. Plan your takeoff according to these variables.
The following takeoff is normal.

When you get permission to take off, taxi out and line up properly.
Advance the throttles slowly, using them to obtain directional control.
As soon as the plane is rolling straight, equalize the throttles and
advance them smoothly to takeoff power. Check the engine instruments for
maximum power indications and for irregular operation--- if in doubt cut
off the power. Don\'t load up the engines with a sudden blast of power.
You are operating powerful engines; treat them with care and respect.

Be prepared to make power adjustments during the takeoff. If an engine
fails before you gain critical single engine speed, you must reduce
power quickly to prevent loss of control.

After you start the takeoff run, use the brakes only in an emergency.
Maintain directional control with the throttles and rudders.

.image width="288"}\

Raise the nose wheel off the ground slightly as soon as you have good
control. The angle of attack and the weight of the [B-25]{.keyword} tend
to keep the plane on the ground during the takeoff roll. The takeoff
becomes conventional when a positive angle of attack, with resulting
lift, is developed.

The [B-25]{.keyword} flies itself off the ground. Allow it to do so, for
smoother, easily controlled takeoffs. If the plane attempts to skip and
bounce in slight cross winds, help it lift off the runway, thus
smoothing out the takeoff.

When the airplane is definitely airborne, raise the wheels. **Be sure
there is no possibility of further contact with the ground.** Good
airplanes have been lost through carelessness.

[Figure[ 1]{.fig--title-label-number}: ]{.figtitleprefix
.fig--title-label}Example of a [B-25]{.keyword} taking off


Level off and allow the plane to gain CSE flying speed (140 mph).

Reduce power to maximum climbing power settings. (See chart of Grade 91
and Grade 100 power settings). Don\'t base this power reduction on
distance from the field. The particular situation, load, speed, terrain
features, and altitude determine the proper place for this reduction.

Reduce power as soon as possible, however, to relieve the strain on the
engines. Let the plane climb slowly, gaining speed as it climbs, Reduce
the power to normal climb settings as soon as you establish a constant
climb. Load conditions cause the climb settings to vary slightly.

Maintain a climbing speed between 160 and 170 mph for these reasons:

\
![Takeoff climb
speed](../images/takeoff_climb_speed.png){#takeoff__image_ktr_zfs_cgb
.image width="288"}\

1.  Speed is developed quickly and maintained to allow single engine
    operation if necessary.
2.  Excessively slow climbs prevent proper cooling of the engines at
    high power settings.
3.  You obtain good forward visibility by keeping the nose relatively
    low.

Raise the wing flaps when you have sufficient altitude. This will
normally be about 300 feet above the terrain and between 150 mph and 170
mph. Apply back pressure to the control column as the flaps come up,
increasing the angle of attack of the wings. This defeats any tendency
to settle and lose altitude.

Close cowl flaps as soon as possible after takeoff, but leave them open
if the cylinder-head temperature approaches 200Â°C.
