Some Typical Missions
=====================

The types of practice missions you can expect when learning the
[B-25]{.keyword}.

-   **[Formation Bombing](../mdita/formation_bombing.md)**\
    This is a day, 6-ship formation bombing mission.
-   **[Gunnery Missions](../mdita/gunnery_missions.md)**\
    In this and all ensuing gunnery missions when both ground and water
    targets are used, extreme care must be exercised to see that the
    field of fire is clear of other planes.
-   **[Chemical spray mission](../mdita/ChemicalSprayMission.md)**\
    Background and expectations on the chemical spray missions.
-   **[Day Navigation, Photo-Reconnaissance, and Instrument Let-Down
    Mission](../mdita/day_navigation_photo_reconnaissance_and_instrument_let_down_mission.md)**\
    How this mission works and what\'s expected of every crew member.
