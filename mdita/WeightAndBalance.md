Weight and Balance
==================

 {.body .conbody}
The day when a pilot flew by guesswork is past. One by one the decisions
that were made by intuition, hunches, and guesswork have been taken over
by an orderly system based on knowledge and understanding. Invariably
this has resulted in greater safety and operating efficiency.

In the loading of heavy bombers this is especially true. Ever-changing
tactical requirements, calling for more and more complex combinations of
cargo, fuel, crew, and armament, have made any but precise, accurate
methods too dangerous to consider. This need to get the utmost in
efficiency from every flight high- lights the need for precise control
of weight and balance.

Improper loading, at best, cuts down the efficiency of an airplane.
Maneuverability, rate of climb, speed, and ceiling suffer greatly.

At its worst, it may mean failure to complete a flight, and sometimes
failure even to start a flight, in most cases with a loss of life and
destruction of valuable equipment.

![Structural
failure](../images/weight_overload.png){#WeightAndBalance__image_gyz_gdv_3gb
.image width="288"}\

1.  Causes higher stalling speeds.
2.  Lowers structural safety Limits.
3.  Reduces maneuverability.
4.  Increases length of the takeoff run.
5.  Lowers the angle and rate of climb.
6.  Decreases ceiling.
7.  Increases fuel consumption for a given speed.
8.  Overloads the tires.

\
![Nose
heavy](../images/weight_nose_heavy.png){#WeightAndBalance__image_fjt_3dv_3gb
.image width="288"}\

1.  Increases dives beyond control.
2.  Causes unstable, nose-down tendencies when flaps are lowered.
3.  Increases difficulty in raising nose on landing.
4.  Overloads nosewheel and tire.
5.  Increases pilot strain in instrument flying.
6.  Dangerous if tail structure is damaged.

1.  Increases stall tendency.
2.  Limits low power operation.
3.  Decreases speed.
4.  Decreases range.
5.  Increases pilot strain in instrument flying.
6.  Dangerous if tail structure is damaged.
