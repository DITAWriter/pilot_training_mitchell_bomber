============

 {.body .taskbody}

A few tips on night flying:

 {.note .important .note_important}
[Important:]{.note__title} In night flying, a turn may suddenly change
contact flight to instrument flight. Be ready to fly instruments at any
moment.



1.  [Know the location of your controls.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Always carry a flashlight.]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Use extra care in taxiing.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Use landing lights **alternately** for taxiing, except in very
    congested areas.]{.ph .cmd}
5.  [Use the extension Ught rather than the dome light for reading maps
    and charts.]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [Check all lighting equipment and fluorescent lighting of instrument
    panel before leaving the ground.]{.ph .cmd}
7.  [Make an accurate check of your flight instruments.]{.ph .cmd}
8.  [Switch on the dome light if your eyes feel strained during
    prolonged instrument flight at night. This creates the illusion of
    flying under a hood and relieves strain.]{.ph .cmd}
