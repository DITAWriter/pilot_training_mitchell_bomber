Air Induction System
====================

 {.body .conbody}
Air enters the induction system through air scoops above the nacelle.
The ram action of the air mass supplies the energy to move cold air
through the system.

A carburetor heat control provides an alternate source of air, allowing
heated air to flow from around the cylinder heads to the system.

Normally there is a baffle in the air-mixing chamber. Air entering
horizontally through the cold-air intake is deflected down into the
carburetor inlet. Under dusty atmospheric conditions an air filter in
the air-mixing chamber replaces the baffle.
