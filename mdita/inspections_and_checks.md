Inspections and Checks
======================

 {.body .conbody}
You have a very personal reason for wanting to know that your airplane
is in the best possible condition for a flight.

That reason is you. If anything happens to the plane, it also happens to
you and your crew.

Use your checklists. You are entrusted with the lives of a highly
trained crew and valuable equipment. The plane and its crew are your
only business while you are its pilot.

There are too many controls which must be set properly, too many
instruments and indicators to be checked, to allow for any but the most
definite procedures, always systematically planned and executed.

These checks and inspections will not take a lot of your time. When
proficient, you can check and inspect the whole plane thoroughly in the
time you usually waste for lack of a definite procedure.

Consult the crew chief about the status of the plane. You will pick up
many of valuable tips from him.

 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_Preflight .section .section}
Preflight {#preflight .title .sectiontitle}
---------

Enter cockpit and check that all switches are \"[OFF]{.keyword
.option}\"

Check Form lA for status of the airplane. Surface controls locked. Trim
tabs set at \"[0]{.keyword .option}.\"

Pull props through 12 to 15 blades if the airplane has been standing for
more than 30 minutes. This will work the oil from the lower cylinders.

If you start the engine with excess oil present in the cylinders this
oil will form a pressure block, cracking the cylinder heads and bending
the connecting rods.

Always pull the props through in the direction of rotation. Otherwise
fuel and oil will be forced back into the intake section. This will
cause an unknown and possibly dangerous fuel-air ratio and make starting
difficult.

 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_NoseSection .section .section}
Nose Section {#nose-section .title .sectiontitle}
------------

Bombardier\'s escape hatch unlocked. Check bombardier\'s compartment for
proper stowage.

Shimmy damper pin (⅜-inch extension). Nosewheel towing lockpin
engaged---Red acorn-nut covering this pin must be in place and secure.
Rotate clockwise until hand-tight. The towing lockpin locks the
nosewheel into position. (The cover will not engage if this pin is
unlocked.)

Nosewheel oleo strut for proper clearance.

\
![Preflight nosewheel oleo strut for proper
clearance](../images/preflight_nosewheel.png){.image width="288"}\

Tires for cuts, wear, blisters, slippage, and proper inflation.

Ground tire on nosewheel for contact with ground.

Nosewheel door for proper fitting and tension (40 lb.). Spring tension
closes this door when the airplane is in flight. If it closes improperly
the slip-stream forces it open, and the resulting air blast may tear it
of! and damage other parts of the airplane.

Nose hood locked and safetied ([B-25]{.keyword} G, H, and TB-25).

Check engine fire extinguisher fuse if installed.


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_RightEngineSection .section .section}
Right Engine Section {#right-engine-section .title .sectiontitle}
--------------------

Carburetor air scoop cover removed.

Propeller for nicks, propeller dome and governor for leaks.

Check pulleys, cables, and safety wires.

Colws, cowl flaps, and Dzus fasteners secure--- a loose cowl section can
be a serious hazard in flight.

Exhaust stacks, fingers, gaskets and studs, for looseness and cracks.

Oil sump magnetic plugs safetied.

Oleo strut (extension 2⅞ inches), brake lines for leaks, torque arm
scissors, main wheel down-lock engaged.

Tire for cuts, bruises, excessive wear, slippage, and proper inflation.

\
![Preflight tire](../images/preflight_tire.png){.image width="288"}\

Battery jar in nacelle for proper servicing.

Wheel chocks in place.

Gasoline drain plugs properly safe tied.


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_RightWingSection .section .section}
Right Wing Section {#right-wing-section .title .sectiontitle}
------------------

De-icer boots for cuts, tears, worn spots, and proper installation.

Pitot head cover removed.

\
![Preflight, remove pitot head
cover](../images/preflight_pitot_head_cover.png){.image width="288"}\

Wing surfaces for wrinkles, dents, or loose rivets. This is an important
check. Wrinkles in the metal surface indicate excessive strain.

Control surfaces for general condition.

Trim tabs neutral at \"[0]{.keyword .option}\" settings.


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_Empennage .section .section}
Empennage {#empennage .title .sectiontitle}
---------

Check for wrinkles, dents, loose rivets, de-icer installation.

Trim tabs neutral at \"[0]{.keyword .option}\" settings.


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_RearCompartment .section .section}
Rear Compartment {#rear-compartment .title .sectiontitle}
----------------

Loading and stowage--- In the photographer\'s compartment sections of
the control cables are exposed on the sidewalls of the fuselage. Check
the stowage carefully at this point; a loose cord, parachute buckle, or
any loose equipment entangled in the controls may cause them to freeze.

Emergency escape hatches unlocked. Emergency landing-gear and flap
lowering mechanisms stowed.

Trailing antenna fully retracted. Entrance hatch closed and latched.


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_LeftWingSection .section .section}
Left Wing Section {#left-wing-section .title .sectiontitle}
-----------------

Repeat the right engine section inspection. Check left nacelle for
stowage of the hand energizer.


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_BombBay .section .section}
Bomb Bay {#bomb-bay .title .sectiontitle}
--------

Check doors for looseness. Check gasoline lines and plugs for leaks.
Check bomb bay for strong gasoline odors. Note: Turn booster pumps
\"ON\" before making this check.


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_General .section .section}
General {#general .title .sectiontitle}
-------

\
![General preflight inspection](../images/preflight_general.png){.image
width="288"}\

Check visually the amount of fuel in each tank.

Check fuel caps for proper installation.

Check visually the amount of oil in tanks and see that caps and Dzus
fasteners are secure.

Check life raft storage compartment release handle \"LOCKED.\"

Crew briefing--- Location and operation of escape hatches.

Proper use of parachutes.

Abandon-ship procedure and signals.

Escape hatches--- Emergency operation. Check with crew chief to
determine the time of the last check on the emergency operation of the
escape hatches.

Testing and operation of oxygen equipment-check crew on knowledge of
proper usage. (Consult your Pilots\' Information File.)

Interphone operation.


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_NavCompartment .section .section}
Navigator\'s Compartment {#navigators-compartment .title .sectiontitle}
------------------------

\
![Preflight emergency air brake
pressure](../images/preflight_emer_air_brake_press.png){.image
width="288"}\

Emergency air brake pressure (550-600 lb. sq. in.).

Nosewheel pawl \"[OFF]{.keyword .option}\" handle stowed. The cable on
this system moves as the nosewheel is raised and lowered. If the
engaging pawl is \"[ON]{.keyword .option}\" the movement of the
nosewheel will tear the cable out of the system. (On later-series
aircraft, hydraulic emergency systems replace this type. When you
operate ships with these installed, safety the handle \"[UP]{.keyword
.option}.\")

Brake accumulator pressure 400 lb. sq. in. minimum.

Hydraulic accumulator pressure 400 lb. sq. in. minimum.

Oxygen pressure (where applicable).

\
![Preflight crossfeed and cut-off
valves](../images/preflight_valves.png){.image width="288"}\

Crossfeed \"[OFF]{.keyword .option}.\"

Fuel transfer valve and switches \"[OFF]{.keyword .option}.\" Right and
left engine fuel cut-off valves \"[ON]{.keyword .option}\"

Generators and inverters \"[ON]{.keyword .option}\"--- External power
should be used whenever possible. If external power is not available for
starting, keep inverters \"[OFF]{.keyword .option}\" until engine is
operating.

Level of Hydraulic fluid reservoir (spare fluid aboard).

Cabin heaters \"[OFF]{.keyword .option}.\"

\
![Preflight cabin heaters to
\"OFF\"](../images/preflight_cabin_heaters.png){.image width="288"}\

Check the load and balance of the ship. Check Form F with the load
adjuster. The [B-25]{.keyword} carries great loads and is unstable and
dangerous if the weight is not properly distributed. (For detailed
information, see the PIF and the Weights and Balance section of this
manual.)


 {#inspections_and_checks__sect_Cockpit .section .section}
Cockpit {#cockpit .title .sectiontitle}
-------

Have your parachute fitted to your body and always wear it.

An improperly fitted chute will cause serious physical injury--- protect
yourself.

Adjust seat and belt---If the seat is not locked the acceleration of
takeoff will force the seat away from the controls. You cannot reach the
controls properly even for taxiing if the seat is not forward and
locked.

Escape hatch unlocked, hatch secure.

Controls unlocked, check for free and proper movement. This insures the
release of the lock, and reveals the presence of obstructions to free
movement of the controls.

Parking brakes \"[SET]{.keyword .option}.\" Brake pressure 500 lb. sq.
in. minimum.

\
![Preflight parking
brakes](../images/preflight_parking_brakes.png){.image width="288"}\
![Check controls for free and proper
movement](../images/preflight_controls.png){.image}

Hydraulic selector \"[NORMAL]{.keyword .option}.\" Air brake handle down
and safetied. Landing gear handle \"[DOWN]{.keyword .option}\" and
locked. Wing flaps up, controls neutral. Cowl flaps open, controls
neutral. Set all hydraulic controls except landing gear at neutral when
they are not in use; this prevents loss of fluid and pressure in the
entire system if part of it fails.

Automatic pilot \"[OFF]{.keyword .option}\" and locked. Supercharger
\"[LOW BLOWER]{.keyword .option}\" and locked. All takeoffs must he made
in \"[LOW BLOWER]{.keyword .option}.\" Any attempt to do otherwise robs
the engines of power.

Oil shutters as required. Carburetor heat \"[NORMAL]{.keyword .option}\"

\
![Preflight throttles](../images/preflight_throttles.png){.image
width="288"}\

Throttles cracked (V2 inch to 1 inch).

Propellers \"[INC. RPM]{.keyword .option}.\"

Mixture \"[IDLE CUT-OFF]{.keyword .option}.\"

Radios \"[OFF]{.keyword .option}.\"

De-icers \"[OFF]{.keyword .option}.\"

Airspeed selector \"[STATIC]{.keyword .option}.\"

Altimeter set (station elevation). This setting will enable you to check
the radioed altimeter setting and detect any scale error in your
altimeter.

\
![Preflight gyros](../images/preflight_gyros.png){.image width="288"}\

Gyros \"[UNCAGED]{.keyword .option}.\"

\
![Preflight battery](../images/preflight_battery.png){.image
width="288"}\

Battery-disconnect switches \"[ON]{.keyword .option}\" (unless external
power is used). Light switches as required.

\
![Preflight fuel](../images/preflight_fuel.png){.image width="288"}\

Check fuel levels--- the visual preflight check acts as a check on the
instrument reading.
