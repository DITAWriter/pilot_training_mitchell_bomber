Single Engine Operation
=======================

 {.body .conbody}
Single engine operation of the [B-25]{.keyword} follows a logical
pattern of procedure. The plane flies efficiently on one engine at a
reduced speed.

Beyond a weight of 32,000 lbs. you will experience some difficulty in
maintaining altitude. This should never be a serious handicap, since you
can always correct it by ridding the plane of excess weight.

Competent ground and air instruction must precede any single engine
practice or operation. On the ground your training should include a
detailed account of the technique of single engine flying and cockpit
drill in the sequence of operation.

You can\'t get too much cockpit time.

Accidents never just happen. They are the culmination of a chain of
events. Don\'t be cocksure; this breeds a lack of respect for your
plane, and this is the first stop toward trouble.

In the air you must know what to expect from aerodynamic forces: the
difference in handling at different speeds, the effect of open and
closed bomb bay doors, the dropping of excess weight, and the futility
of using flaps except in landing.

Each airplane has a critical single engine speed. In the
[B-25]{.keyword} it is 140 mph for normal load weights.

Critical single engine speed is the slowest speed at which the rudder
has a sale margin of control over the unbalanced thrust of the one live
engine, at maximum power.

Maximum power settings for single engine flight depend on the particular
conditions. You can apply power in direct relation to the air- speed. At
high speeds it is possible to use take- off power settings for a short
time.

For all normal single engine operation, keep your power settings at
maximum climb or below. The airplane becomes difficult to control beyond
this power setting unless you have excess airspeed. If you have excess
speed, you don\'t need excessive power.
