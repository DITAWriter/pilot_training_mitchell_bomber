# Oxygen {#oxygen .concept}

The B-25 has two systems of oxygen supply. The first is a permanent installation in the early-series aircraft, the second a portable system in later-series B-25 aircraft.

The permanent oxygen system is of the low-pressure type, operating at an average starting pressure of 400 lb. sq. in. There are three low-pressure oxygen cylinders in each nacelle, two at the front and one at the rear. The cylinders, held in place by padded metal straps, are removable.

One filler valve in each nacelle allows servicing of the system, A relief valve in the bomb bay relieves overload pressure on the oxygen system caused by overfilling of oxygen cylinders or thermal expansion.

The oxygen system has eight low-pressure regulators. A pressure gage in each regulator shows the pressure of the entire system. The valve, operated by turning a knob on the lower part of the regulator, adjusts the amount of oxygen flow. A dial on the face of the regulator indicates the oxygen flow in thousands of feet of altitude, thereby simplifying regulator adjustment.

An outlet tube extends outward from the bottom of each regulator, and the hose from the oxygen mask slips over this tube. The outlet tube of the upper turret operator's regulator is on the upper turret support column.

When oxygen is not being drawn from a regulator, be sure that the valve is completely closed to prevent leakage.

Type A-8B masks are used with this system and permit breathing through either the mouth or the nose, The small valve at the bottom of the re-breather bag is for draining of any water collecting in the bag. A low-pressure rubber tube connects the mask to the regulator. Use a weak solution of creosol to clean and sterilize the mask parts.

The portable oxygen system consists of two or more low-pressure units. Each unit, comprising cylinder, regulator pressure gage, filler valve, and the necessary fittings, lines, and supports, is complete and independent. Each portable oxygen unit employs one F-1 type cylinder having a working pressure rating of 400 lb. sq. in. The regulator gages, lines, and fittings are on one end of the cylinder and the drain is in the port at the opposite end.

A demand-type regulator feeds oxygen to the mask. It automatically admits into the system the proper amount of air from the cabin, the quantity depending on the altitude, and releases the mixture as the user inhales.

The tube assembly which conducts the mixture to the mask is clamped to the regulator elbow. Adjust the position of the elbow by loosening the nose coupling which attaches the elbow to the regulator, moving the elbow to the proper position, and tightening the nose coupling. It is important that the coupling and all other connections be tight at all times.

If the regulator fails, it may be bypassed by turning the red emergency knob in a counter-clockwise direction to "ON." A lever controls the automatic mixture feature of the regulator. When the auto-mix is turned "OFF" the regulator releases pure oxygen to the mask.

An A-10 revised or A-14 type mask may be used with the portable oxygen unit. Before any flight on which you expect to use oxygen, see that the mask is of the proper type and is the correct size and shape for your face.

DANGER

Keep all oxygen equipment free from contact with oil or grease. Failure to do this may result in an explosion.
