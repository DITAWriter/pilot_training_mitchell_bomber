It's OK to let Elmer take over and do some of your flying for you, particularly to relieve you of the strain caused by long over-water flights. Or, if you are cruising over the top and need to be very accurate in your cross country courses, let Elmer fly.

**Remember, though, that the autopilot is a machine. It cannot do your thinking for you. Use it as an aid to flight, not to do your flying and particularly not your thinking.**

Experience has demonstrated that the instantaneous control responses of the autopilot under flight conditions which might cause side-slip or stall, may result in a spin. Because of this, the following restrictions are placed on its use.

Do not use it in extremely turbulent air. You can, if you choose, use it to aid you but you must be on the controls also.

Do not use it when the deicer system is in operation.

Do not use it if both engines are not delivering normal power.

Do not turn it on until you are sure that flight conditions permit safe control by the autopilot.

Maintain at least minimum cruise power settings. The B-25 is too sluggish at low speeds to permit safe operation on autopilot.

Never operate the autopilot unless one rated pilot is on watch in the cockpit. You must constantly check the instruments, and the trim of the plane must be accurate.

Never engage the autopilot unless the indices are lined up properly.

Never make course and altitude changes rapidly with the autopilot.

When the autopilot is engaged, never turn the speed valves to "O" setting. This will lock the corresponding surface controls in their position.

## Ground Checklist {#sect_GroundChecklist .section}

1.  Check suction–3.75" to 4.25" Hg.
2.  Check oil pressure–75 to 90 lb. sq. in.
3.  Check bank-and-climb unit uncaged.
4.  Check directional unit uncaged.
5.  Engage autopilot and check operation by moving each control knob. Watch the surface controls for corresponding movements.
6.  Check for air in the Servo units by moving the normal surface controls, A springy reaction shows the presence of air in the system.
7.  Disengage autopilot, leave gyros uncaged.

## In Flight {#sect_InFlight .section}

1.  Trim the plane hands-off.
2.  Set Servo controls at No. 4.
3.  Set rudder follow-up card to match directional gyro card.
4.  Set aileron follow-up card to match bank index.

5.  Set elevator follow-up card to match elevator alignment index.

    CAUTION:

    Do not set the elevator follow-up card to match the horizon bar. Their relative movement is in opposite directions.

6.  Move the "ON-OFF" control to the "ON" position slowly.
7.  Adjust the Servo speed controls as needed.

    These controls are calibrated from to 8, the speed range of operation is \(locked\) to 8 \(high speed reaction\). If the instrument is in good condition, the proper setting for the B-25 is between 2 and 4. These need not read the same for all controls.

8.  Set fore and aft attitude with the elevator knob.
9.  Set directional control with the rudder knob.
10. Set in bank when you want to turn more than 5 degrees.

    **Note:** Always keep the gyros uncaged except during maneuvers that exceed the operating limits of the autopilot. These are 50 degrees from the vertical for the bank-and-climb unit and 55 degrees for the directional gyro unit.


**Warning:** During flight do not overcontrol the autopilot more than 15 degrees, This causes the autopilot to attempt an abrupt return to the original position, with possible damage to the control surfaces and the autopilot.

The autopilot gives accurate control with a plus or minus tolerance of 1 degree. It flies a far better course than a human pilot.

When the autopilot is in use for extended periods, be sure to disengage it at least once every half hour to check the trim manually. This instrument will not give efficient performance if it is operating against the pressures of the trim tabs.

If the Servo speed controls are improperly set, the plane oscillates or hunts for a stable position. If this happens, open the Servo speed controls and slowly turn them toward the closed position. Do not close them completely, but find the point at which the oscillation stops. Adjust the controls slowly back and forth at this point until you obtain the desired setting.

**Warning:** Always be sure you can overpower the autopilot manually. Try it on the ground before you fly.
