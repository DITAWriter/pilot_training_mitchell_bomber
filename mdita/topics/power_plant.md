# Power Plant {#power_plant .concept}

The B-25 is powered by two Wright Cyclone R-2G00-13 or R-2G00-29, 14-cylinder, double-row radial engines.

The operation of these two series is similar. Primarily air cooled, these engines have two secondary methods of cooling:

1.  Scavenged engine oil cooled by 2 oil coolers located in the outboard section of each wing before it is returned to the engines.
2.  Rich fuel mixtures cool the engines at high power settings.
3.  Individual flame-damping exhaust stacks reduce exhaust flame visibility at night.

## Supercharger {#supercharger .section}

A supercharger is to an internal-combustion engine what an oxygen mask and a supply of oxygen is to a pilot.

An integral part of the R-2600 engine is the internal 2-speed, gear-driven supercharger. It supplies the necessary manifold pressures for high-altitude operation.

The impeller, acting as a power fan, is driven at a 7.06:1 ratio in low blower and 10.06:1 in high blower. This passes the fuel-air mixture from the carburetor and adapter at increased pressures to the manifold. The manifold distributes the mixture to the intake ports and the cylinder heads.

## Accessory Section {#accessory_section .section}

The accessory section, on the rear of the engine, contains various devices for supplying pressures and operational action to the airplane.

These are:

1.  Right and left scintilla magnetos
2.  Generator
3.  Inertia starter
4.  Fuel pump
5.  Oil pump
6.  Scavenger pump
7.  Hydraulic pump
8.  Vacuum pump
9.  Cuno automatic filter
10. Tachometer drive gear
11. A number of instrument fittings complete this section.

## Carburetor {#carburetor .section}

![Holley Carburetor](../images/holley_carburetor.png "The Holley Carburetor")

Holley variable-venturi carburetors operating at pressures of 6 to 7 lb. sq. in. supply the engines with fuel.

The carburetors are the pressure-metering type. By operating the throttles, you control the amount of air passing the venturi throats; the air, by its varying pressures, measures the amount of fuel allowed to enter the adapter section and mix with the air. This establishes a predetermined fuel-air ratio.

These carburetors incorporate several devices to increase and decrease the fuel-air ratio in relation to the engine power output.

1.  **Compensator System**—A bleed line operated by a spring-loaded check valve and diaphragm. When you use high throttle settings, it allows a richer mixture to reach the cylinders to cool the cylinder heads properly.
2.  **Accelerating Pump**—A device to supply an additional charge of fuel when you open throttles suddenly. It corrects for a time lag in the regular supply. It is diaphragm operated and cuts out when the mixture control is in "IDLE CUT-OFF."
3.  **Mixture Control**—Allows you to set the carburetor for cruising lean which improves fuel economy and fuel mixtures under all operating conditions.
4.  **Stabilizer Valve**—A slide valve which acts as an automatic mixture control, compensating for changes in temperature and pressure.
5.  **Power Mixture Valve**—A diaphragm-operated bypass valve. When you open throttles to high power settings, it cuts the manual mixture control out of the system, and prevents you from taking off with cruising mixtures.
6.  **Vapor Separator**—A needle-valve and float device for diverting fuel vapor into the adapter where they mix with the normal mixture and pass to the impeller section.
7.  **Primer**—A needle valve in the fuel inlet casting to facilitate starting the engine.
