# Ditching: Landing procedure {#DitchingLandingProcedure .concept}

Consult the [PIF](../glossentries/gl_PIF.md) and your personal equipment officer for general information on landing in the water. They will help you determine wind direction, wind speeds, surface conditions, and other valuable information.

Trim the ship for hands-off flight and establish a normal power approach. Lower the flaps between 20 degrees and 30 degrees. Full flaps will lower the airspeed a few mph but will also increase your angle of descent dangerously.

Retard your rate of descent with the throttles. The flattest approach is by far the best. As you near the water, level off, raising the nose to a nose-high position, and lower the remaining flaps. Make a power landing in the same attitude you would use on a runway.

At high operating speeds the prop tips will strike the water with dangerous force. If they do not rip the engine from the plane they will damage the nacelle and the leading edge of the wing causing the plane to sink faster.

Because of this, play your approach to enable you to flare off and land with a constantly decreasing load of power. If you have misjudged slightly, **don't blast the throttles open unless you can go around**.

Cut The throttles and switches as the tail strikes the water. There will be a definite impact as the tail strikes. Do not confuse this with the impact that will follow when the nose strikes. **This second impact will be violent.**

The nose will bury itself, and the plane will ship water through the pilot's escape hatch. Don't keep this hatch closed, however, as it may jam on impact and trap you in the airplane.

The bombardier's section, if it is installed, will rupture and water will flow through the crawl way.

The plane will nose up to a 45째 angle and settle back to about 15째 nose down. Water will enter the pilot's cockpit and fill it to a level with the top of the instrument panel Expect this, and don't get panicky. Water will enter the right-rear escape hatch when it is opened, and the exit may have to be made by ducking into the water to get out.

The length of time the B-25 will float depends on the amount of damage the airplane suffers in landing, and on the condition of the sea. Usually it will float for 5 to 7 minutes. You can safely expect at least 1 minute. Since a well-drilled crew can escape and board the life raft in 15 to 20 seconds, see that your crew is well drilled and you need not worry about how long the plane will float.

Don't make an exaggerated tail-low landing, as the impact of the tail will rupture the rear fuselage and may snap the nose into the water violently before the plane can lose its excess speed.
