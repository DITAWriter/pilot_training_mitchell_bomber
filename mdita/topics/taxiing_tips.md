# Taxiing Tips {#taxiing_tips .concept}

A short list of useful tips to know when taxiing.

-   Never pivot on the inside wheel during a turn.
-   Never turn sharply at high speeds.
-   Do not use more power than necessary when taxiing.
-   Be extremely careful when taxiing on a strange airfield.
-   In the immediate vicinity of other planes, never taxi faster than is necessary to maintain control. Always proceed under guidance from the ground.
-   When taxiing over soft smooth terrain and there is a tendency of the wheels to dig in, don't stop.
-   Keep the plane moving unless the situation is dangerous. If in doubt, stop. Get out and look. Have a crew member walk ahead of the plane until you are out of trouble.
-   Do not turn sharply info the parking area. Come up behind the parking position and move the airplane ahead slowly.
-   Never cut the engines with the idea of rolling to a stop. Lack of hydraulic pressure may cause brake failure.
-   Do not run up engines if light planes are behind you.
