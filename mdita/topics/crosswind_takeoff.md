# Crosswind Takeoff {#crosswind_takeoff .task}

Modern flying, with its heavy airplanes, demands a runway for safe operation. The days when you taxied out, lined up parallel to the wind tee, and took off are gone forever.

Instead of 360 degrees of airfield available for takeoff, the modem airfield has three runways, usually set to take advantage of the six cardinal points of the prevailing winds. Using these runways, you encounter cross winds of varying degrees and intensities.

The aids to a crosswind takeoff are the rudders, the throttles, the aileron, and, as a last resort, the brakes.

The technique is:

1.  Make the usual takeoff checks.

2.  Advance the throttles, leading with the upwind throttle. The strength of the wind will determine the amount of lead.

3.  As the speed increases and the rudders become effective, equalize the throttles.

4.  Leave the ground with the throttles evenly set and use just enough rudder and aileron to make a coordinated turn into the wind, thus counteracting any drift.

    **Note:** The plane may skip as the speed increases toward the end of the takeoff roll. This is an indication that it is ready to fly. Help it along to prevent skipping and to keep the consequent side thrust from injuring the landing gear.

**Common Errors**

-   Failure to recognize the drift.
-   Trying to correct the drift by skidding instead of turning into the wind. This increases the stalling speed and if violent enough it will put the plane back on the ground. The bounce will be made with the drift applying a side thrust to the gear.
-   Juggling the throttles, giving uneven control. Lead the upwind throttle, constantly reducing the lead. As the speed increases the rudder control is great enough to take off cleanly.
