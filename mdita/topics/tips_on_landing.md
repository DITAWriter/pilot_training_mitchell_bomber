# Tips On Landing {#tips_on_landing .concept}

A list of things to know that will make your landings easier on you and on the B-25.

Don't let the nosewheel strike immediately after landing.

You can easily control the position of the nosewheel with the elevator.

Hold the nose well up after landing. This reduces the length of the roll considerably.

Excessive use of brakes is not necessaryâ€”the rudders give ample control.

Use the brakes in accordance with the amount of runway available.

The speed decreases considerably during the roll. Therefore, emergency operations with the brakes can be delayed to prevent damage to the airplane.

On slick runways the B-25 is exceedingly difficult to control. Land short, and slow the plane as much as possible without brakes.

Guard the throttles on all landings to prevent creeping.

Never apply the brakes until the nosewheel is on the runway.
