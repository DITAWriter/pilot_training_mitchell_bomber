Landing Lights—An 8-inch, sealed-beam landing light is in the leading edge of each outer wing panel and is operated by a switch on the pilot's control pedestal.

Passing Light—Located beside the landing light in the left outboard wing panel, it is controlled by a switch on the pilot's switch panel \(not installed on late series B-25\).

Position Lights—The position lights consist of a red light on the outer edge of the left wingtip, a green light on the outer edge of the right wingtip, and a white frosted light on the outboard surface of each vertical stabilizer. Two switches on the pilot's switch panel operate these lights. Each switch has an independent "BRIGHT" and "DIM" position for the wing and tail lights, separately controlled.

Formation Lights—The formation lights, colored blue, are mounted on the upper surface of the fuselage and horizontal stabilizer so they will not be visible from the ground. There are 3 lights aft of the upper turret on the center line of the fuselage and 4 lights on the horizontal stabilizer approximately 3 inches forward of the elevators. A rheostat, acting as both switch and intensity adjustment, controls all 7 lights \(not installed on late series B-25 aircraft\).

Recognition Lights—The recognition lights comprise a white lamp on the upper surface of the fuselage above the radio compartment, and red, green and amber lights on the lower surface of the right wingtip. A bank of 4 toggle switches on the left side of the pilot's control pedestal operates the lamps in any desired combination. They can be set to burn continuously or to flash off and on by means of a keying switch on the toggle switch box.

CAUTION:

Do not keep the recognition lights on for more than a few seconds with the airplane on the ground, as serious damage to the lenses will result.

## Interior Lighting {#sect_IntLighting .section}

Dome lights are located in the pilot's, bombardier's, navigator's, bomb bay, and radio compartments. The controls for the dome lights are in their respective compartments.

Extension lights are in the pilot's, bombardier's, and navigator's compartment. Switch controls of these lights are on each unit. They can be extended approximately 4 feet.

## Instrument Lighting {#sect_InstLighting .section}

Fluorescent lamps are in the bombardier's compartment and on the pilot's and copilot's control columns. Intensity of these lights is adjustable by rheostats, adjacent to the lamps.

The pilot's magnetic compass light is in the compass itself; a rheostat on the pilot's switch panel controls it.

All optical gunsight lights are inside the sights. The rheostats which control them are near each unit.
