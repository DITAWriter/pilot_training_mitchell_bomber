# Critical periods in ditching {#CriticalPeriodsInDitching .concept}

There are two critical periods in ditching:

1.  The actual landing and handling of the airplane on the water. This is the sole responsibility of the pilot.
2.  The immediate abandonment of the airplane in an orderly manner after ditching. This requires the perfect coordination of the entire crew. Even in a training fuselage in a hangar, this cannot be done efficiently without a great deal of practice. After a severe shock with the fuselage rapidly filling with water, safe and speedy abandonment is impossible unless the drill has been painstakingly planned and practiced. Every crew member must know his job and the drill to the last detail. Many crews have saved themselves by carrying out a well-executed drill. **This required advance practice and a great deal of it.**
