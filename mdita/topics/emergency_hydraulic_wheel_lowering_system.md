# Emergency Hydraulic Wheel Lowering System {#emergency_hydraulic_wheel_lowering_system .task}

The B-25 has an emergency hydraulic wheel lowering system to provide power if the main hydraulic wheel lowering system fails. The system provides for simultaneous lowering of main landing gear and nose gear.

The system consists of an emergency hand pump and a hydraulic fluid reservoir, both in the navigator's compartment. The complete system incorporates automatic valves to regulate normal and emergency flow of fluid to the operating struts, a nosegear up-lock release cable connecting the hand pump handle and the up-lock latch, and fluid transmission lines.

The emergency reservoir fills automatically when the main reservoir is filled, and the fluid is available for the emergency lowering of the landing gear even if the main hydraulic system fluid is completely lost.

**Operation**

If the hydraulic system fails completely, take the following steps:

1.  Return to the home base if possible. Report your trouble briefly to the tower.

2.  Climb to an altitude of at least 5000 feet above the surrounding terrain.

3.  Reduce your airspeed below 150 mph.

4.  Place landing gear control handle in pilot's compartment "DOWN."

5.  Operate emergency hand pump one full stroke to release nose gear up-lock. Check landing gear indicator to see whether nose gear is partially extended. If not, give the pump handle another full stroke.

6.  Operate the hand pump until gear is down and locked. Employ your normal checks to insure that gear is actually down and locked.

7.  Return pump handle to forward position and safety it.

    Some earlier models of the B-25 have mechanical emergency wheel lowering controls. In these models, you lower the main landing gear and the nose gear separately. The controls consist of screw jacks and a series of cables which operate directly on the wheels.
