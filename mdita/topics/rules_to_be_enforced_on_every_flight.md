## Training {#training .section}

1.  Tell your crew the purpose of each mission and what you expect each to accomplish.
2.  **Keep the crew busy throughout the flight.** Get position reports from the navigator; send them out through the radio operator. Put the engineer to work on the cruise control and maximum range charts. Require the copilot to keep a record of engine performance. Give them a workout. Encourage them to use their skill. A team is an active outfit. Make the most of every practice mission.

## Inspections {#inspections .section}

2.  Check your crew for equipment, preparedness, and understanding of what you expect from them.

## Interphone {#interphone .section}

2.  Require reports by interphone every 15 minutes from all crew members when on oxygen.
