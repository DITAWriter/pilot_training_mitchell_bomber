# Day Navigation, Photo-Reconnaissance, and Instrument Let-Down Mission {#day_navigation_photo_reconnaissance_and_instrument_let_down_mission .task}

How this mission works and what's expected of every crew member.

This mission will consist of a controlled ground speed day navigation and photo-reconnaissance mission, at the end of which the pilot will orient himself by the X Radio Range and simulate a let-down to Home Base. If first attempt is unsuccessful, a second orientation and let-down will be accomplished.

1.  **Conduct of Mission:**
2.  This mission will be briefed by the Squadron S-2. All crew members will take careful notes as directed by S-2, and will be interrogated upon return as to observation. Oblique and pinpoint photographs will be taken. Target maps are available for the localities directed below and photographs will be taken of each given target.

3.  **Specific Duties of Crew Members**
4.  Pilot—will aid and direct crew in obtaining observations; give careful attention to best photographic procedures; direct photographs be taken as briefed; and communicate on interphone at all times.

5.  Copilot—will take notes on installation noted by himself and pilots and accomplish all normal copilot duties.

6.  Navigator-Bombardier

    1.  Will navigate by DR Navigation on a V-P chart except within 10 minutes of target area where pinpoint pilotage will be used on a sectional chart.

    2.  Act as observer and perform duties as briefed by S-2.

    3.  Maintain and submit navigation log, weather observations, and other data to Squadron Navigation Officer.

7.  Radio Operator—will transmit position reports submitted by Bombardier-Navigator, and practice tracking from all gun positions.

8.  Engineer-Gunner—will perform all normal duties and also act as observer.

9.  Armorer-Gunner—will preflight and install photo equipment; take photos as directed by pilot; make observations of ground activity; and man battle station at all times, taking careful observations and reporting to the pilot all aircraft and ground installations sighted.
