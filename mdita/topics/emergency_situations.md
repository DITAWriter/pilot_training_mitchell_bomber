This section covers what to do in specific emergency situations, including fire aboard the B-25 while in flight, bailing out, forced landings and ditching the airplane.

-   **[Fire in Flight](../topics/fire_in_flight.md)**  
The deadly enemy of all flyers is fire in the air.
-   **[Bailout](../topics/bailout.md)**  
Take good care of your parachute, keep it clean and free of grease and moisture.
-   **[Forced Landings](../topics/forced_landings.md)**  
Forced landing in the B-25 is at best a difficult job.
-   **[Ditching](../topics/ditching.md)**  
With the tactical needs of World War II calling for the operation of land planes over vast stretches of water, airmen faced a new hazard: ditching—the forced landing of land planes at sea.
