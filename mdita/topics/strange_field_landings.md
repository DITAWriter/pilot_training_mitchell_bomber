# Strange Field Landings {#strange_field_landings .concept}

Flying above your home base you instinctively use familiar features of landscape to orient yourself. Your judgment of distance, altitude, speedy and depth are sharpened.

![Look it over before you decide to land.](../images/landing_strange_field.png)

You have probably walked into the familiar front room at home, neatly sidestepped the lamp, and continued on your way in total darkness. This same perception of familiar objects operates in every flight you make.

When away from familiar terrain, however, you may have trouble in setting the base leg at the proper place, judging the approach leg, and even regulating your speed properly.

There is a tendency toward poor depth perception when coming down from a higher altitude. All these things, while small, increase in unfamiliar surroundings.

Let down to the traffic altitude gradually and give your eyes a chance to become adjusted. Watch your speed. Because you have been flying at higher speeds you may have a tendency to fly the traffic pattern too fast and mismanage the landing.

While the local pattern is well understood, it is harder to set up the same pattern or to conform to local regulations at another field. Plan your way clearly and confidently,- use your head and your eyes; take things calmly.

In landing at a strange field, come in over the field and circle once above it in the direction of traffic. Check carefully the altitude of the field and get the traffic altitude from the tower. If you cannot get specific instructions, fly the traffic pattern 1000 feet above the terrain, Obtain wind direction and velocity, line up the proper runway, visualizing exactly what you intend to do, and then drop down and enter the traffic pattern.

Get a normal base leg, establish your glide at the proper angle and airspeed, and make a power approach landing.

The power approach is important in handling the B-25. The longer you maintain the power and the closer to the ground you cut it off, the more exact is your judgment of where the airplane will land. Use the power, however, only as an aid, and not to make a low dragging approach.

After landing, call the control tower for taxiing and parking instructions.

## Common Errors {#sect_CommonErrors .section}

1.  Low dragging approach with no clear conception of the field altitude. This is the result of poor planning.
2.  A fast approach, the result of tenseness. Trust your plane and fly it calmly and confidently. Don't get excited.
3.  Poor radio procedure, usually caused by poor tuning. Be accurateâ€”learn procedures perfectly and use them as you have learned them. This isn't book flying; it is just, plain common sense.
