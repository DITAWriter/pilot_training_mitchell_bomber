# Procedure for Reclosing Bomb Bay Doors {#procedure_for_reclosing_bomb_bay_doors .task}

If you have had a hydraulic failure, be sure that the bomb bay doors are not partially open when you jump.

These doors fall open ⅔ of the way when the hydraulic system loses its pressure.

To close these doors, do the following:

1.  Open inner door—this door will not open with the bomb bay door crank installed.

2.  Install crank on coupling.

3.  Close doors and fasten crank to floor.

4.  Complete bailout procedure.
