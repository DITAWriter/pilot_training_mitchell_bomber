# Defrosting Systems {#defrosting_systems .concept}

Where the desfrosting systems are located across the B-25.

The pilot's windshield section, bombardier's bombsight window, bombsight, and the navigator's astrodome can be defrosted by warm air from the airplane heating system. The bomb bay window, the astrodome, and the pilot's windshield receive heat whenever the heating system is on.

The bombsight warm air supply is controlled by a lever on the defrosting tube located on the left side of the bombardier's compartment.

There is a door for cleaning the bombsight window. When not in use, the bombsight defrosting tube can be stowed in clips along the left side of the bombardier's compartment.

When not in use, the end of the astrodome defroster tube can be stored on the left side of the navigator's compartment directly inboard of the window on the upper longeron. To use it, attach the end of the tube to the nozzle permanently installed in the astrodome, or place it in the alternate position by hooking it to the rear of the astrodome.

There is a flexible auxiliary defrosting tube on the floor of the pilot's compartment at the base of the control column. You can remove the free end from the storage clip and extend it as needed for defrosting the interior of the top side windows in the pilot's compartment. The push-pull selector control on the lower panel in front of the copilot directs the flow of air either to the windshield or to the auxiliary defrosting tube.

Special blowers assist the flow of air to the pilot's compartment defrosting system and to the bombsight window in the bombardier's compartment. Switch controls for the blowers are on the pilot's switch panel and on the bombardier's control panel.

This heating and defrosting system is slightly modified and adapted for the different series of B-25 planes. There are no provisions for heating or defrosting the nose of the series G and H planes, and other slight changes occur in other models. Information on these changes may be found in the T.O.'s for these planes.
