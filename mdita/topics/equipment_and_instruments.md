# Equipment and Instruments {#equipment_and_instruments .concept}

This section provides a survey of the key systems, equipment and instrumentation of the B-25 airplane.

-   **[Power Plant](../topics/power_plant.md)**  
The B-25 is powered by two Wright Cyclone R-2G00-13 or R-2G00-29, 14-cylinder, double-row radial engines.
-   **[Air Induction System](../topics/air_induction_system.md)**  
Air enters the induction system through air scoops above the nacelle. The ram action of the air mass supplies the energy to move cold air through the system.
-   **[Fuel System](../topics/fuel_system.md)**  
Each engine has an independent fuel supply, interconnected by fuel transfer and fuel crossfeed systems. The fuel lines and cells are self-sealing.
-   **[Oil System](../topics/oil_system.md)**  
Each engine has an independent oil supply. The self-sealing oil tank mounted behind the firewall on each nacelle has a capacity of 34 gallons.
-   **[Dual Ignition System](../topics/dual_ignition_system.md)**  
The ignition system, except for the induction vibrator coil, is independent of all other electrical power sources.
-   **[Electrical System](../topics/electrical_system.md)**  
The electrical power which operates and controls the various units of the B-25 is supplied by 2 generators, supplemented by 2 storage batteries connected in parallel.
-   **[B-25 Lighting Equipment](../topics/b_25_lighting_equipment.md)**  
Locations of the exterior and interior lighting systems.
-   **[Hamilton Hydromatic Propellers](../topics/hamilton_hydromatic_propellers.md)**  
The Hamilton hydromatic propellers of the B-25 are hydraulically operated.
-   **[Hydraulic System](../topics/hydraulic_system.md)**  
The hydraulic system provides quick and easy operation of the following equipment on the B-25.
-   **[Landing gear](../topics/LandingGear.md)**  
The B-25 has retractable, tricycle landing gear, hydraulically operated.
-   **[Instruments](../topics/instruments.md)**  
The following instruments are installed on the B-25. You need no special instructions for their operation, as they are basically the same as those on any 2-engine bombardment or training airplane.
-   **[Automatic Pilot](../topics/automatic_pilot.md)**  
Most B-25 aircraft have A-3 or A-3A autopilots which operate on a pneumatic-hydraulic principle. They fly the airplane automatically in straight and level flight and make the necessary corrections for holding a given course or altitude.
-   **[Communication Equipment](../topics/communication_equipment.md)**  
Location and types of communication equipment located throughout the B-25.
-   **[Armament](../topics/armament.md)**  
The armament of the B-25 follows basically the same pattern found in any AAF bombardment airplane. The detailed installation varies greatly according to the tactical uses intended.
-   **[Oxygen](../topics/oxygen.md)**  
The B-25 has two systems of oxygen supply. The first is a permanent installation in the early-series aircraft, the second a portable system in later-series B-25 aircraft.
-   **[Photographic Equipment](../topics/photographic_equipment.md)**  
There is a photography station in the fuselage rear section on early-model airplanes.
-   **[Models and Changes](../topics/models_and_changes.md)**  
Combat problems in several theaters of war found the A, B, C, and D models of the B-25 unsuited for certain tactical operations. A series of modifications were necessary to overcome these problems.
-   **[Comparison Equipment Chart](../topics/comparison_equipment_chart.md)**  
Key differences for the equipment load-out for the different variants of the B-25.
-   **[Fuel System Operation](../topics/fuel_system_operation.md)**  
Every man on your crew must know the fuel system so thoroughly that a mistake in its operation is impossible.
-   **[Operating Instructions for the Supercharger](../topics/operating_instructions_for_the_supercharger.md)**  
The supercharger is an integral part of your engine at all altitudes.
-   **[Carburetor Air Heat](../topics/carburetor_air_heat.md)**  
The carburetor air heater on the B-25 is a 2-position gate in the air induction system.
-   **[Carburetor Air Filter](../topics/carburetor_air_filter.md)**  
The true relationship between the effects of the carburetor air filter and engine power output.
-   **[Priming](../topics/priming.md)**  
Priming is necessary to supply a sufficiently rich fuel air mixture to the cylinder heads to facilitate starting of a cold motor.
-   **[Operating the Autopilot](../topics/operating_the_autopilot.md)**  
How and when to operate "Elmer", the autopilot.
