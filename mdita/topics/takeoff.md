# Takeoff {#takeoff .concept}

Takeoff in the B-25 with its tricycle gear, varies from that with conventional gear only during the initial part of the roll. You will find it much easier.

![B-25 taking off](../images/takeoff.png "Takeoff")

The principal difference is in attaining the proper angle of attack of the wing. On the conventional type you start from a stall attitude and reduce the angle to permit flight. In the B-25 you start from a negative angle of attack and increase the angle of attack by raising the nosewheel.

Several factors affect the takeoff technique. Chief of these are gross weight, wind velocity, type of runway, and the height and distance of the nearest obstacles. Plan your takeoff according to these variables. The following takeoff is normal.

When you get permission to take off, taxi out and line up properly. Advance the throttles slowly, using them to obtain directional control. As soon as the plane is rolling straight, equalize the throttles and advance them smoothly to takeoff power. Check the engine instruments for maximum power indications and for irregular operation—if in doubt cut off the power. Don't load up the engines with a sudden blast of power. You are operating powerful engines; treat them with care and respect.

Be prepared to make power adjustments during the takeoff. If an engine fails before you gain critical single engine speed, you must reduce power quickly to prevent loss of control.

After you start the takeoff run, use the brakes only in an emergency. Maintain directional control with the throttles and rudders.

![Once airborne, raise the wheels to ensure a smooth flight](../images/takeoff_raise_gear.png "Raise the gear as soon as plane is definitely airborne")

Raise the nose wheel off the ground slightly as soon as you have good control. The angle of attack and the weight of the B-25 tend to keep the plane on the ground during the takeoff roll. The takeoff becomes conventional when a positive angle of attack, with resulting lift, is developed.

The B-25 flies itself off the ground. Allow it to do so, for smoother, easily controlled takeoffs. If the plane attempts to skip and bounce in slight cross winds, help it lift off the runway, thus smoothing out the takeoff.

When the airplane is definitely airborne, raise the wheels. **Be sure there is no possibility of further contact with the ground.** Good airplanes have been lost through carelessness.

![Ensure to raise the wheels after takeoff](../images/takeoff_gear_control.png "Takeoff gear control")

1.  Lift the safety lock holding the control handle "DOWN" and locked.
2.  Move the mechanical lock up.
3.  Move the landing gear handle to "UP."

![Level off to gain flying speed](../images/takeoff_level_gain_CSE_speed.png "Takeoff level gain CSE speed")



Level off and allow the plane to gain CSE flying speed \(140 mph\).

Reduce power to maximum climbing power settings. \(See chart of Grade 91 and Grade 100 power settings\). Don't base this power reduction on distance from the field. The particular situation, load, speed, terrain features, and altitude determine the proper place for this reduction.

Reduce power as soon as possible, however, to relieve the strain on the engines. Let the plane climb slowly, gaining speed as it climbs, Reduce the power to normal climb settings as soon as you establish a constant climb. Load conditions cause the climb settings to vary slightly.

Maintain a climbing speed between 160 and 170 mph for these reasons:

![Maintain speed when climbing](../images/takeoff_climb_speed.png "Takeoff climb speed")

1.  Speed is developed quickly and maintained to allow single engine operation if necessary.
2.  Excessively slow climbs prevent proper cooling of the engines at high power settings.
3.  You obtain good forward visibility by keeping the nose relatively low.

Raise the wing flaps when you have sufficient altitude. This will normally be about 300 feet above the terrain and between 150 mph and 170 mph. Apply back pressure to the control column as the flaps come up, increasing the angle of attack of the wings. This defeats any tendency to settle and lose altitude.

Close cowl flaps as soon as possible after takeoff, but leave them open if the cylinder-head temperature approaches 200°C.
