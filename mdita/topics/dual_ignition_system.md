# Dual Ignition System {#dual_ignition_system .concept}

The ignition system, except for the induction vibrator coil, is independent of all other electrical power sources.

There are 2 magnetos on each engine. The right magneto furnishes spark to the front plugs and the left to the rear plugs in both banks of cylinders.

Dual ignition provides more efficient combustion, decreasing the possibility of detonation. It also acts as a safety factor by providing 2 separate ignition systems on each engine.

Since the magnetos do not furnish sufficient spark until they are turning 75 to 85 rpm, it is necessary to provide starting spark from an induction vibrator coil It is in the power panel junction box and steps up 24-volt current to 20,000-25,000 volts at a low amperage output. To operate it, engage the starter with the meshing switch. High-voltage spark is sent to the right magneto, firing the front plugs as they are less likely to foul. The induction coil continues to operate until the meshing switch is released.

CAUTION:

Caution: Never keep the induction vibrator coil in continuous operation, as tremendous heat is generated, and the coil will burn out.

Necessary lines, fuses, and switches complete the ignition system.
