# Before Takeoff - C.I.G. F.T.P.R.-Friction Brake {#before_takeoff_c.i.g.f.t.p.r._friction_brake .reference}

Checklist to ensure that your Controls move freely, Instruments function, proper Gas settings, then to check Flaps, Trim, Props are set for takeoff, and then Run up the engine before removing the friction brake.

## Controls for free movement {#sect_Controls .section}

Remember: C.I.G. F.T.P.R.-Friction Brake.

## Instruments {#sect_Instruments .section}

1.  Altimeter
2.  Directional gyro set and uncaged
3.  Artificial horizon set and uncaged
4.  Suction 3.75-4.25" Hg.
5.  Oil pressure 75 to 90 lb. sq. in.
6.  Oil temperature 50째C to 85째C
7.  Cylinder-head temperature 100째 to to 205째C

## Gas {#sect_Gas .section}

1.  Fuel pressure 6-7 lb sq. in.
2.  Fuel levels
3.  Booster Pumps "OFF"
4.  Transfer Pumps "OFF"
5.  Mixture "FULL RICH"
6.  Carburetor heat "NORMAL"
7.  Shut-off valves "ON"
8.  Crossfeed "OFF"

## Flaps {#sect_Flaps .section}

Flaps set for takeoff \(normal 20 degrees\). Run the flaps full down and then raise them to 20 degrees.

## Trim {#sect_Trim .section}

Trim tabs set for takeoff.

## Props {#sect_Props .section}

Props "INC. r.p.m."

## Run-up {#sect_RunUp .section}

Friction brake snug, booster pumps "ON," bomb bay doors closed.
