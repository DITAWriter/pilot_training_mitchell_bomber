# No-Flap Landing {#no_flap_landing .task}

Occasionally both in combat and normal operations your plane may be damaged to the extent that flaps cannot be lowered for landing.

The use of full flaps reduces your landing speed approximately 20 mph; therefore, a slightly different technique is required for landing when using no flaps.

You must be familiar with this technique:

1.  Add approximately 10 mph to your normal gliding speed.

2.  Keep the plane's attitude almost level on the approach.

3.  Use less elevator control and more power than normal in the roundout. \(In some instances, it may be necessary to use considerable power to decrease your rate of descent.\)

    **Note:** 

    When making no-flap landings always land on the first few feet of the runway. Your landing speed is greater and your landing roll much longer.

    Don't let the nosewheel touch the ground before or with the main wheels.
