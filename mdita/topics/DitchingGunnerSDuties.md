1.  Switch to interphone and acknowledge the emergency bell

2.  Remove the rear escape hatch. Jettison all loose equipment ammunition cans, guns, chutes, spare coils, etc.,

3.  Close the hatch. This must be closed for landing, otherwise it will act as a scoop and allow entry of a great mass of water into the rear of the ship. This may damage the structure and cause the rear section to break off, greatly endangering your chances of getting out.

4.  See that all rear personnel have their life vests on and that the vests **are not inflated**.

5.  Lock rear armor bulkhead open, so that tail position and side windows may be used for escape.

6.  Obtain the thermos bottle and keep it in your possession.

7.  Brace for the impact on the pilot's signal.

8.  Abandon ship. Remove the escape hatch. See that the radio operator releases the life raft. Carry the thermos bottle out and proceed to the raft.
