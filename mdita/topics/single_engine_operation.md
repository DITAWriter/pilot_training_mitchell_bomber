# Single Engine Operation {#single_engine_operation .concept}

Single engine operation of the B-25 follows a logical pattern of procedure. The plane flies efficiently on one engine at a reduced speed.

Beyond a weight of 32,000 lbs. you will experience some difficulty in maintaining altitude. This should never be a serious handicap, since you can always correct it by ridding the plane of excess weight.

Competent ground and air instruction must precede any single engine practice or operation. On the ground your training should include a detailed account of the technique of single engine flying and cockpit drill in the sequence of operation.

You can't get too much cockpit time.

Accidents never just happen. They are the culmination of a chain of events. Don't be cocksure; this breeds a lack of respect for your plane, and this is the first stop toward trouble.

In the air you must know what to expect from aerodynamic forces: the difference in handling at different speeds, the effect of open and closed bomb bay doors, the dropping of excess weight, and the futility of using flaps except in landing.

Each airplane has a critical single engine speed. In the B-25 it is 140 mph for normal load weights.

Critical single engine speed is the slowest speed at which the rudder has a sale margin of control over the unbalanced thrust of the one live engine, at maximum power.

Maximum power settings for single engine flight depend on the particular conditions. You can apply power in direct relation to the airspeed. At high speeds it is possible to use takeoff power settings for a short time.

For all normal single engine operation, keep your power settings at maximum climb or below. The airplane becomes difficult to control beyond this power setting unless you have excess airspeed. If you have excess speed, you don't need excessive power.
