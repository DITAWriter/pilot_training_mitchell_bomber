A checklist on what to do if you need to use the hydraulic brake on your B-25 on landing.

Before landings if there is less than 1000 lb. pressure indicated on the brake system pressure gage:

1.  Turn hydraulic selector valve to "BRAKE."

2.  Operate the hand pump until indicator shows 1000 lb. sq. in. minimum and no more than 1450 lb. sq. in.

3.  Operate continuously while landing and taxiing as the initial pressure in the accumulator is insufficient for normal landing.

4.  If, on landing, you cannot maintain sufficient pressure, use the emergency air brake system.

5.  If you cannot build up 600 lb. pressure in the accumulator, pick a field with at least a one-mile runway, land and use the air brake system.

    Always make a short-field landing when your brake pressure is low.
