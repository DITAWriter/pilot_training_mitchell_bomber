# Single Engine Operation Procedure {#single_engine_operation_procedure .task}

Critical single engine airspeed must be maintained at the sacrifice of all other considerations.

1.  Airspeed—Maintain or get 140 mph by diving if necessary.

2.  Directional control—Obtain and hold directional control by using rudder.

    Slight aileron aids coordination but excessive use raises the stalling speed.

    Use the trim tabs to help you hold the plane if manual control is too difficult. Make these checks:

    1.  Check your ignition switches.

    2.  Check your fuel cut-off valves.

    3.  Move mixture control to "FULL RICH."

    4.  Turn the booster pumps "ON."

    You can make these checks in far less time than it takes to read these lines; they may save the engine, and they prevent featheritis.

3.  Increase power to the limit allowed by airspeed and rudder control— Advance both prop controls and both throttles.

    It is sometimes difficult to tell which engine is out. As a precaution, apply power to both engines.

    A good method when you are not sure: If the plane wants to turn to the right, the right engine is dead; to the left, the left engine is dead. If you are on instruments, your bank-and-tum needle points to the dead engine.

4.  Reduce drag. **Throttle back. Decrease rpm. or feather the prop. Mixture "IDLE CUT-OFF"** gear and flaps up, generators on—Feather the propeller by pushing the feathering button down.

    The prop will feather, and when it does the button will return to normal position.

5.  Close cowl flaps on dead engine.

6.  Reduce fire hazard—After the prop stops turning, cut off the fuel and ignition on that engine. Set the Lux system to the dead engine, and be prepared if a fire breaks out.

7.  Trim—Trim the plane for hands-off flight.


This may seem a complicated procedure; however, when you have practiced it a few times, when you know exactly what you are going to do, the entire procedure requires less than 10 seconds.
