# Flight in Cold Weather {#flight_in_cold_weather .task}

Your anti-icing and de-icing equipment is primarily intended as a means of getting you out of icing levels.

Don't fly in icing levels any longer than is absolutely necessary.

1.  Check your free air temperature gage before any flight where ice is anticipated.

2.  After taking off from snow or slush-covered fields, operate the landing gear and flaps through several cycles to insure against the gear and flaps freezing in the up position.

3.  Turn the pitot tube heater "ON" when moisture is present. Pitot tube heat should not be applied until the airplane is on the takeoff run or actually in the air, as there is insufficient cooling in the pitot head while the plane is stationary.

    **Note:** With pitot tube heat "ON" your magnetic compass may oscillate as much as 15Â°.
