# Climb {#climb .concept}

Making your B-25 climb properly without straining your arms or your airplane.

How do you climb the B-25? Simple, you say â€”just pull her nose up. That is a definite part of the procedure, but unless a little more thought and a little less muscle accompanies the pulling you will ruin a good airplane.

The minimum safe climbing speed for proper cooling is 155 mph. Climbing at lower speeds overheats and ruins the engines.

Establish a normal climb at 160 to 170 mph using correct power settings. Trim the plane for hands-off flight. This allows you to concentrate on your surroundings. Turn as you climb so that you can spot approaching air traffic.

Turn the booster pumps "OFF" above 1000 feet. Set your power at the desired cruising settings when you reach your desired cruising altitude. Move the mixture control to "CRUISING LEAN" if long-range cruise settings are used. Level oft and make any necessary adjustments in power and trim.
