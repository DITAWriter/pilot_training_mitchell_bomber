# Wing Flap Emergency Lowering System {#wing_flap_emergency_lowering_system .task}

In the event of **complete** failure of the main hydraulic system, an emergency mechanical flap lowering mechanism is available.

It is important to remember to use the emergency mechanism only when the hydraulic system failure is **complete**, as the two systems oppose each other. Use of the emergency system while hydraulic pressure is still available will seriously damage the mechanical system.

The emergency mechanism is in the radio compartment. Be sure the interphone communication between the crew member operating the mechanism and the pilot is 100% effective.

Before entering the traffic pattern it is advisable to lower partial flaps. This enables you to get desired amount of flaps earlier on the final approach.

**Operation**

1.  Reduce airspeed below 150 mph.

2.  Move pilot's flap control "DOWN."

3.  Remove hand crank from stowage position on forward wall of radio compartment and engage it with the shaft.

4.  Rotate crank clockwise until you obtain the desired amount of flaps -14 turns will give you half flaps; 27 turns, full flaps.

5.  To lock flaps in position, remove the crank.

    **Note:** If go-around is necessary, turn crank counterclockwise to full stop position. \(This operation does not raise the flaps, but releases the pressure on them and the force of the slipstream raises them.\)

    **Warning:** Before operating the flaps hydraulically again, be sure that your mechanical system is fully disengaged. To disengage, rotate crank counter-clockwise until checked. Remove crank and return to its stowage position.
