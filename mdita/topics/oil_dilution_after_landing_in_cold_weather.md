# Oil Dilution After Landing in Cold Weather {#oil_dilution_after_landing_in_cold_weather .concept}

To obtain sufficient dilution of the oil to facilitate starting, allow the engine to cool either by idling or stopping after flight, before dilution begins.

This will prevent rapid evaporation of the gasoline and insure that the viscosity of the oil has been reduced sufficiently. In most cases you will find that the engines have cooled sufficiently for dilution by the time the airplane reaches the flight line.

Dilute the engines at 1000 rpm for the time indicated below, consistent with the lowest expected air temperature.

|Temperature|Time—Minutes|Maximum Allowable Temperatures|
|-----------|------------|------------------------------|
| | |**Cyl. Head**|**Oil**|
|+4 to -12°C\(+21 to 0°F\)

|6|150°C|50°C|
|-12 to -29°C\(0 to -20°F\)

|10|145°C|45°C|
|-29 to 46°C\(-20 to -40°F\)

|14|140°C|40°C|

**Warning:** Unreliable dilution occurs at these temperatures if the oil tank is more than ¾ full.

At the completion of the above dilution period, run both engines up to 1700 rpm, continuing dilution, and with propellers in full "INC. RPM" feather and un feather each propeller through one complete cycle. Operate each propeller governor through one complete cycle. Release dilution switch and decrease engine speed. Stop engines and install engine covers.
