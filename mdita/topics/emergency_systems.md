# Emergency Systems {#emergency_systems .concept}

This section covers all of the emergency systems, including the emergency hydraulic wheel lowering system, wing flap system, hydraulic and air brakes, what to do in the event of a complete failure of the hydraulic systems, and miscellaneous emergency equipment.

-   **[Emergency Hydraulic Wheel Lowering System](../topics/emergency_hydraulic_wheel_lowering_system.md)**  
The B-25 has an emergency hydraulic wheel lowering system to provide power if the main hydraulic wheel lowering system fails. The system provides for simultaneous lowering of main landing gear and nose gear.
-   **[Procedure in Event of Complete Failure of Hydraulic System](../topics/procedure_in_event_of_complete_failure_of_hydraulic_system.md)**  
A checklist to follow if the hydraulic system on the B-25 fails.
-   **[Wing Flap Emergency Lowering System](../topics/wing_flap_emergency_lowering_system.md)**  
In the event of **complete** failure of the main hydraulic system, an emergency mechanical flap lowering mechanism is available.
-   **[Emergency Operation of Bomb Bay Doors](../topics/emergency_operation_of_bomb_bay_doors.md)**  
Use the mechanical system only when hydraulic pressure fails.
-   **[Emergency Salvo Release](../topics/emergency_salvo_release.md)**  
When your hydraulic system is in operation you can salvo all of your bomb load, both internal and external, by moving the bomb control handle to the "SALVO" position.
-   **[Emergency Operation-Hydraulic Brake](../topics/emergency_operation_hydraulic_brake.md)**  
A checklist on what to do if you need to use the hydraulic brake on your B-25 on landing.
-   **[Emergency Operation-Air Brakes](../topics/emergency_operation_air_brakes.md)**  
Use this Air Brake System only in extreme emergencies.
-   **[Miscellaneous Emergency Equipment](../topics/miscellaneous_emergency_equipment.md)**  
Information on all of the remaining emergency equipment, including the alarm bells, life raft and life preservers, emergency fuel pump, pyrotechnic signal pistol the radio demolition switch, hand ax, first-aid kits and fire extinguishers.
