How the become an effective airplane commander and keep your crew ready for action at anytime by maintaining discipline.

The commander of the B-25 must be more than a pilot. As his title implies, he must be a leader of menâ€”a leader in a special sense. He must not train his crew as automatons, but as a team which will use initiative and perform its tasks to one end only...the success of the mission.

You are the leader. The successful coordination of the work involved in getting your plane to its objective and back to its base depends a great deal on the way in which you lead.

When you are thoroughly familiar with the jobs the members of your crew are doing, you've won half the battle of being the commander of your airplane.

The second half of the battle consists in knowing your men as individuals as well as members of the crew. Do you know where your tail gunner was born? Is your crew chief married? What work was your navigator doing before he got in the Army? How does your bombardier like his job on the B-25?

Naturally, you don't ask these questions of your crew as if you were a desk sergeant at the night court. If you're going about things the right way, you may never have to ask. Your men will volunteer the information. Men always talk about themselves when they're fairly sure their listener is really interested.

They'll know whether you're interested if you look out for their comfort on flights and between flights. If you're away from base overnight, you may find it necessary to finance one crew member or another. Be sure that every crew member is properly fed, quartered, and clothed. The manner in which you take care of their needs will make or mar your reputation with your crew.

You need a lot of tact in handling these things. Your best rule of thumb for getting to know and take care of your crew should go something like this: "Is my interest in the crew getting the best out of them for the teamwork I need to fly my plane?" But be sure you don't overdo it. Your tail gunner isn't going to be too happy if you tell him that his crap-shooting is blistering his trigger finger. But you're not overdoing it if you pull a plate of gas-forming food out from under his hungry eyes just before a high-altitude mission.

## Crew Discipline {#crew_discipline .section}

Discipline in an air crew means that you are commanding respect and getting your orders obeyed. It also means that a lot of the time you're not finding it necessary to give orders at all. Your crew members are performing their duties without having to be told.

A good way to develop the jitters about your plane and your crew is by keeping them at a distance, talking to them pompously, and by showing favoritism or uncertainty in your decisions.

![Don't find yourself on the other side of a wall from your crewmates. You need to work effectively together.](../images/crew_discipline.png "In a little while you'll find yourself working on one side of a 10-foot wall
                    while your crew works on the other")

On the other hand, you won't get discipline by dropping all distinctions between commander and crew and letting the waist gunner call you Joe.

Somewhere between these two methods there is a happy medium which will insure that any order you give will bring instant obedience and maintain respect and mutual confidence.

You can be friendly without becoming familiar, understanding without becoming a father-confessor, and firm without emulating Simon Legree. Give direct orders only when there is a need for orders. Once you issue an order, see that it is always obeyed.

## Ready for Action {#ready_for_action .section}

Are your guns working? The only way you can be sure is to know how competent and reliable your gunners are. It is disastrous to get caught by a swarm of enemy fighters and find that your guns won't function.

What about your navigator? Does he know his job well enough to get you over that pinpoint target a thousand miles from any visible fix?

Is your bombardier sure that his equipment is in perfect condition? Has he remembered to warm up his bombsight to prevent fogging at the critical moment?

You can't know the precise answers to all the questions involved in having your plane ready for action, but you can know most of the important questions. Learn enough about every man's job so that you can ask the right questions, and you'll find that your crew will be there with the right answers at the right time.
