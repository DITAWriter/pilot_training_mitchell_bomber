# Dealing with Engine Fires {#dealing_with_engine_fires .task}

Formerly a great many fires started in the carburetor.

At present, because of the many improvements in carburetion, few engine fires start in this manner. The most common cause today is the mechanical failure of some part.

To combat a carburetor fire:

1.  Cut off gas to the engine.

2.  Mixture control in "IDLE CUT-OFF."

3.  Throttle full forward.


This quickly empties the carburetor and exhausts the fuel that is burning. In most cases no other action need be taken.
