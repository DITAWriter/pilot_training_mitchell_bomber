# Power-Off Landing {#power_off_landing .concept}

The B-25 is too large and heavy to practice the prescribed forced-landing procedures used in lighter planes.

 ![](../images/landing_power_off.png) 

The power-off approach allows the pilot to become familiar with all the factors involved in a forced landing without the hazards involved in actually practicing them.

The power-off approach duplicates exactly the conditions of a forced landing with these exceptions:

1.  You make the landing with wheels down instead of up.
2.  You make the landing on a known field.

    These landings acquaint the pilot with the power-off gliding characteristics of the B-25 and improve his judgment for an actual forced landing.


Make a power-of approach and landing as follows:

1.  Fly a normal traffic pattern and hold your altitude through the last turn into the field.
2.  Hold your altitude until you are in position to make a glide to the end of the runway.
3.  Reduce the power and establish a normal glide short of the end of the rim way.
4.  Lower the desired amount of fiaps.
5.  Make a normal roundout and landing.

CAUTION:

In an actual emergency make the landing with wheels up unless you are over a known airfield. This increases the gliding distance of the plane. Make allowances for the increased gliding distance.

In an emergency use the prop to vary the glide of the airplane.

To increase drag, move the prop control to "INC. RPM."

To decrease drag, move the prop control to "DEC. RPM."
