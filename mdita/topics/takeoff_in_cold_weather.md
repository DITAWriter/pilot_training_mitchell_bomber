# Takeoff in Cold Weather {#takeoff_in_cold_weather .task}

Short checklist on what to look for when attempting to take off during cold weather conditions.

**Warning:** Your cabin heaters must be "OFF" before takeoff.

1.  Never take off if there is any snow, ice, or frost on the wings. Even the thinnest layer of frost may cause loss of lift and treacherous stalling characteristics. In extreme conditions it may be necessary to taxi out to the takeoff position before removing the protective covers from the flight surfaces.

2.  In ordinary operation, carburetor air controls should be in "NORMAL" for takeoff. In extremely cold weather, however, it is often advisable to place carburetor air control in "ICING" during takeoff to insure proper fuel vaporization.

    **Note:** \(You will seldom find these extreme conditions in the continental United States. In arctic zones, consult experienced pilots before employing this procedure.\)
