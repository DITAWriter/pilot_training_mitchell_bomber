# Single Engine Trouble Search {#single_engine_trouble_search .task}

How to troubleshoot issues with a single engine.

1.  Firstâ€”Switch the vacuum selector to the good engine to get accurate readings of instruments.

2.  With the plane under control, try to find out what caused the trouble, and, if possible, make temporary repairs. Check all fuses, cut-off valves, pop-out switches, lines and wiring as well as you can.

3.  Don't try to re-start the engine if you don't know what is wrong. It is much simpler to make a single engine landing than to fight a fire.

4.  Adjust the cowl flaps and the oil cooler shutters as desired. Reduce weight if the plane is excessively heavy. Drop bombs, bomb bay tank, tools; in fact, anything that will come loose, if necessary. Make final adjustments on the trim and power setting.
