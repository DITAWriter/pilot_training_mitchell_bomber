# Common landing errors {#common_landing_errors .concept}

1.  A reluctance to go around or failure to anticipate the necessity.
2.  Waiting until the airplane is too low and moving too slowly before deciding to go around.
3.  Failure to add sufficient power or adding power too slowly, thus losing altitude.
4.  Raising the wheels before applying power.
5.  Starting climb without a safe airspeed.
6.  Raising the last 15 degrees of flaps without increasing the angle of attack of the wings, causing an uncontrolled sinking.
7.  Tenseness, causing a hurried procedure. Learn the procedure thoroughly, use it with confidence, perform each step calmly and deliberately as needed.
