# Formation Bombing {#formation_bombing .task}

This is a day, 6-ship formation bombing mission.

![Bombing in formation.](../images/formation_bombing.png "Formation bombing")

1.  A Norden sight will be used in the lead ship on each element and D-8 sights will be used in wing ships. Bombardiers in lead ships will sight for both range and deflection. Bombardiers in wing ships will drop bombs on lead ship.

2.  Flight leader will take off at a predetermined time; other ships will take off at 30 second intervals and join formation.

3.  After formation has been satisfactorily joined, one circle will be made of the field. During this circle, formation will climb at 170 mph.

4.  Flight leader should have an approximate power setting of 32" MP at 2200 rpm. Climb will continue on course until an altitude of 10,000 feet is obtained. High blower will not be used and all ships will keep mixture controls in "FULL RICH" position.

5.  Upon reaching the desired altitude, the leader will assume that anti-aircraft fire has been encountered, and evasive action will be used.

6.  Upon approaching the target, a gentle left turn, diving at 1000 feet per minute onto the target, will be executed. This final turn requires judgment and precision timing on the part of the lead ship. After diving to the correct bombing altitude \(8000 feet\), and onto the target, the lead ship should be in a position to allow approximately a 20 second bomb run, straight and level. Immediately upon the closing of the bomb bay doors, the leader will again make a left turn, diving at 1000 feet per minute with a bank not to exceed 15 degrees. This dive will be held until 7000 feet altitude is reached. The following data should be strictly observed:

    1.  The lead ship should climb at 170 MPH, with approximate power settings of 32" MP and 2200 RPM. The wing ships should use 2400 RPM.

    2.  After altitude is reached, power settings of lead ship should not exceed 1900 RPM and 27" at any time. The wing ships should use at least 2000 RPM,

    3.  Copilots must be sure that RPM is increased if the MP dictates it.

    4.  The bombing run should be made at an indicated airspeed of 230 MPH, and upon leaving the target, should not exceed 250 MPH.

    5.  Wing ships will open bomb bay doors immediately upon seeing doors of lead ship open, and bombs will be dropped on the lead ship, **The Bombardier-Navigator must be quick in releasing bombs after he sees the first bomb leave the lead ship.**

    6.  Caution must be used by the lead ship at all times. Turns and maneuvers must be gone into gently and slowly.

    7.  After bombing is completed, flight will return to home base and break up into three-ship elements for landing.
