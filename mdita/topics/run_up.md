# Run-up {#run_up .task}

The process for doing a run-up prior to takeoff.

1.  Advance the throttles to 1600 rpm.

2.  Pull back prop controls until a reduction in rpm of 350-400 is indicated.

3.  Re-set prop controls to "INC. RPM." \(Manipulation of prop controls circulates warm oil in the prop dome and gives smoother governing action.

4.  At 1600 rpm, check generators' output: voltage at 28 to 28.5, amperes 20 to 60.

5.  Advance the throttle on your coolest engine until the rpm is set at 2000. Maximum manifold pressure 28.5" Hg. Check the right and left mags. For a thorough check, the time on one mag is 2 to 3 seconds. Between checks on "L" and "R" settings return the switch to "BOTH" and allow the engine to regain speed. A loss of 73 to 100 rpm does not necessarily mean that the plane is unsafe for flight. If the engine does not vibrate excessively during the check, and if it will put out rated power, a drop of 75 to 100 rpm is considered safe for takeoff. However, he on the lookout for a drop in rpm. If the drop is sudden, or if backfiring occurs, do not fly the plane until it has been re-checked. A drop of 100 rpm is the maximum permissible for takeoff.

6.  Repeat this procedure on the other engine.

7.  Following the mag check, run the engines up singly to 30" Hg. At this manifold pressure you will get an approximate reading of 2400 rpm, which means that the plane should give you sufficient power for takeoff.
