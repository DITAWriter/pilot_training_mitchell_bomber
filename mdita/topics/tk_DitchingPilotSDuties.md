# Ditching: Pilot's Duties {#tk_DitchingPilotSDuties .task}

Make the decision to ditch.

The rest of the crew must coordinate their duties with those of the pilot. Crew members can practice their duties, and go through a drill, each performing a defined action on a number called by the pilot. For simplification these duties are listed in the order in which they should be done.

1.  Warn the crew by alarm bell—this bell is attached to all positive leads on the plane. If either battery-disconnect is on and any current remains in the battery, it will operate.

2.  Use the interphone—get an acknowledgment from each crew member.

3.  Turn IFF to "EMERGENCY"

4.  Check the fuselage tanks and bombs, and salvo if necessary. Close the bomb bay doors—they must not be open for the landing.

5.  Landing gear up—check it!

6.  Get wind direction and velocity from navigator.

7.  Signal copilot to lower flaps as required.

8.  Notify crew to brace for the impact \(interphone or bell\).

9.  Cut mixture, cut switches just prior to landing. Leave battery-disconnect switches "ON."

10. Notify navigator to cut gas supply, unless gas cut-off switches are in the pilot's cockpit.

11. Give alarm bell signal to abandon plane after landing.
