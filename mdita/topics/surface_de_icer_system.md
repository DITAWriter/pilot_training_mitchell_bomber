# Surface De-icer System {#surface_de_icer_system .concept}

The location and scenarios for using the de-icing systems on you B-25.

![B-25 de-icing system.](../images/surface_deicer_system.png "Surface de-icer system")

Conventional air-inflation de-icer boots are mounted on leading edges of wings and empennage. A rotary distributor valve in the well of the navigator's compartment furnishes air to the boots in a 5-phase cycle every 40 seconds.

When the de-icer system is not in operation, suction provided by the vacuum pumps on both engines prevents aerodynamic negative pressures from raising the de-icer boots.

Operation of the surface de-icing system is automatic when the control is turned "ON."

There is a pressure gage for the de-icer system in the rear of the navigator's compartment. This gage should read approximately 7 lb. sq. in. under normal operating conditions. Should the pressure go above 10 lb. sq. in., the maximum pressure, immediately turn the control "OFF" and check for the difficulty.

CAUTION:

Do not operate the de-icer during landing or takeoff. Never operate the de-icer system at speeds above 230 mph; negative pressure on leading edge of wings will expand the de-icer boots, causing them to rupture.
