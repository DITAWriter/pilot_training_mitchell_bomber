# Cold Weather Operations {#cold_weather_operations .concept}

Cold weather operations bring visions of long arctic nights, glaciers, Eskimos, and stories you have heard of the Far North.

But it is well to bear in mind that during the winter months many sections of the United States have climatic conditions requiring just as much specialized maintenance as the Arctic.

Granted that the conditions are not as severe, it is still important that you know how to care for your plane.

Where the defrosting systems are located across the B-25.
-   **[Heating System](../topics/heating_system.md)**  
The airplane has two independent heating systems; one for heating the navigator's, pilot's, and bombardier's compartments, the other for heating the radio operator's compartment and the interior of the fuselage aft of it.
