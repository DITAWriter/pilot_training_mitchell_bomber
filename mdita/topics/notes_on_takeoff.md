# Notes on Takeoff {#notes_on_takeoff .concept}

Do not dive the airplane after lifting it at the end of the takeoff run. When you level out to pick up CSE speed after takeoff release the stick pressure as the speed picks up.

**Gain critical single engine speed immediately after takeoff.** This is the slowest speed at which the rudder has a safe margin of control over the unbalanced thrust of the live engine at full power. In the B-25, it is **140 mph**.

Don't be an instrument pilot on takeoff. Fly the airplane by feel and by visual reference to the ground. An occasional check of the instruments is a necessity, but make instrument takeoffs only when contact flight is impossible. Attention to the panel should be concentrated on the engine instruments.
