# Procedure in Event of Complete Failure of Hydraulic System {#procedure_in_event_of_complete_failure_of_hydraulic_system .task}

A checklist to follow if the hydraulic system on the B-25 fails.

In the event of complete failure of your landing gear hydraulic system, operate the emergency controls as follows:

1.  **Operation**

2.  Establish effective interphone communication between the crew member operating the mechanism and the pilot.

3.  Return to the home base if possible. Report your trouble to the tower.

4.  Climb to an altitude of at least 5000 feet above the surrounding terrain.

5.  Reduce the airspeed below 150 mph \(120-130 mph recommended.\)

6.  Place landing gear control handle in pilot's compartment "DOWN."

7.  Swing screw jack in radio compartment to the operating position.

8.  Pull up-latch release and check to see that the main gear has released.

9.  Operate the screw jack \(clockwise\) to lower the gear,

10. Use normal landing gear check to see that the gear is down and locked.

11. Release the tension slightly on the screw jack after the gear is down and locked.

    **Warning:** Don't return this system to a stowed position until the plane is safely on the ground, with the landing gear locked to prevent its folding up.

    You must stow this system before the wheels can again be operated hydraulic ally.

12. **Nosewheel**

    The lowering device for the nosewheel is in the navigator's compartment, on the step into the pilot's compartment.

    To operate:

13. Pull nose gear release.

14. Check to see that the gear has released.

15. Turn the nosewheel pawl "ON."

16. Place crank on shaft, turn clockwise to lower.

17. Check locked position normally after the gear is full down.

    **Warning:** The nosewheel lowering cable operates every time the nosewheel is raised or lowered. It is engaged by the pawl to lower the wheels. If the pawl is accidently turned to "ON" the hydraulic system will tear the nosewheel cable out of the plane.

    This pawl must be left "ON" after it is used until the plane is on the ground and braced against mishap.
