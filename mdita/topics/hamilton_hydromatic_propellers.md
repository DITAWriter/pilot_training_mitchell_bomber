# Hamilton Hydromatic Propellers {#hamilton_hydromatic_propellers .concept}

The Hamilton hydromatic propellers of the B-25 are hydraulically operated.

Their special features are automatic constant-engine-speed operation and the ability to feather and unfeather quickly in an emergency.

The actuating mechanisms operate in an oil bath, thereby minimizing wear and the chance of mechanical failure.

Constant-engine-speed control is achieved by an engine-driven governor metering oil to and from in the actuating dome assembly. Engine oil under 75-90 lb. sq. in. pressure, plus the centrifugal twisting moment of the blade, decreases blade angle. Engine oil at a boosted pressure of 180-200 lb. sq. in. pressure increases blade angle.

Feathering and unfeathering is accomplished by an independent auxiliary oil system controlled from the cockpit.

## Principle of Operation {#sect_PrincipleOperation .section}

Angular blade movement of the propellers is obtained by converting the straight-line motion of the piston to circular movement by the cams. Oil pressure drives the piston forward or backward.

## Constant-speed Control {#sect_ConstantSpeedCtrl .section}

The propeller governor assembly maintains rpm settings established by the pilot.

The governor consists of 2 flyweights geared to the operation of the crankshaft. These fly-weights adjust the load on the engine by raising or lowering a pilot valve which allows oil under pressure to be metered to the propeller dome, thereby increasing or decreasing the blade angle.

**On-speed—** An on-speed condition exists when the engine is turning at the selected rpm. The pilot valve has closed the pressure and drain ports in the governor, maintaining the blades at a fixed blade angle.

**Overspeed—** An overspeed condition indicates that the engine rpm has increased beyond the original setting. To counteract this condition, engine oil flows to the governor. There a booster pump increases pressure of the oil to 180-200 lb. per sq. in. Entry of this oil to the inboard side of the propeller dome is permitted when the pilot valve opens the pressure port, moving the piston forward and thus increasing blade angle and decreasing engine rpm.

**Underspeed—** An underspeed condition indicates that the engine is running slower than the selected rpm. To correct this, the pilot valve is forced downward, opening the drain port. Oil drains from the inboard side of the piston in the propeller dome. The centrifugal twisting moment of the blades, plus engine oil pressure on the outboard side of the piston, moves the blades to a lower angle, thus increasing engine rpm to the selected setting.

## Feathering the propeller {#sect_Feathering .section}

![How feathering affects the angle of the propeller.](../images/feathering.png "Feathering the propeller")

You feather a propeller by actuating the feathering control button on the pilot's pedestal. An electric feathering pump supplies oil at 400 lb. sq. in. through a transfer valve. Through this valve the oil bypasses the governor to the propeller dome. Pressure is then built up on the inboard side of the piston, twisting the blades to the full-feathered position \(90°.\) When the blades are at this angle, pressure increases sufficiently to operate a cut-out switch, disengaging the feathering pump.

## Unfeathering {#sect_Unfeathering .section}

To unfeather a propeller hold the control button down. This operates the feathering pump, applying pressure through the same passages used for feathering. Since further travel of the piston is no longer possible, oil pressure at 600 lb. sq. in, shifts a distributor valve to its outboard limit, which reverses the oil passages to the propeller dome. The pressure is now applied to the outboard side of the piston and moves it inboard, decreasing the blade angle. Hold control button down until the propeller is windmilling at 800 rpm. Then resume control in a normal manner.
