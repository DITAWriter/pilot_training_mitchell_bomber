# Short-Field Takeoff {#short_field_takeoff .concept}

The short-field takeoff is an important operational maneuver. You can easily understand its importance if you stop to consider that the first Tokyo raid could never have been made without its use.

Many tactical fields have been kept open after a severe bombing simply because our pilots were proficient in this maneuver.

Heavy planes with high wing loadings must often be flown from small fields. The combination of large bomb loads, full fuel cells, loaded ammunition boxes, and poor runways, makes high demands on your skill. Since these loads are gone at the completion of a mission, the landing must take second place to the takeoff wherever the combat operation of the airplane is concerned. Successful short-field takeoffs call for maximum use of every favorable characteristic of the plane. They are directly related to your future as an operational pilot.

The short-field takeoff is a maximum performance maneuver. Know your stalls and slow flying before practicing it.

## How {#sect_HowTo .section}

After completing the cockpit check, line up at the extreme end of the runway and set the flaps to the maximum lift-drag position—30 Set the parking brakes, advance the power to within 5" Hg. of the maximum allowed, and wait for the rpm indications to become constant.

Check to see that the nosewheel is pointed straight ahead and release the brakes. Use the remaining 5" Hg. to control the direction until rudder control is effective, then neutralize the throttles.

Under conditions of high ground friction, heavy grass, sand, or mud, you must make this run with the nosewheel well off the ground. On smooth runways make the takeoff run in a tail-level or minimum drag attitude.

You will take off more quickly on soft runways if the nosewheel is lifted as quickly as possible, and on hard runways if you allow the speed to build up; then apply lift to the wings.

The airplane should leave the ground just after the flaps-down, wheels-down, power-on stall speed is reached. When definitely airborne, retract the wheels, allow the airspeed to build up slightly, and climb until clear of any obstacle. Lower the nose to pick up CSE speed. When you have sufficient altitude, raise the flaps to 15°. When you attain a safe flying speed and altitude, reduce the power to maximum climb and raise the remainder of the flaps.

Prolonged climbs at low airspeeds raise the engine operating temperature dangerously—do not practice them.
