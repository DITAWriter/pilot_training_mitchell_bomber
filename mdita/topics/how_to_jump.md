1.  Face rear of ship and place hands on structure above rear of hatch.

2.  Lower legs through opening. The slipstream will carry your legs up against the underpart of the fuselage. Twist your shoulder to the left to prevent injury to the head on the way out. Push away from the plane with your hands.

3.  When you are sure that you are clear of the plane, look directly at the ripcord release and take hold of the handle.

4.  Straighten your legs, keeping your feet together, and pull the release. In a low-altitude jump, pull the release as soon as possible.

    For further information on bailout technique, consult your *Pilot's Information File*.
