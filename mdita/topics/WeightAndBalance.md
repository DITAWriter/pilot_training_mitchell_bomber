# Weight and Balance {#WeightAndBalance .concept}

The day when a pilot flew by guesswork is past. One by one the decisions that were made by intuition, hunches, and guesswork have been taken over by an orderly system based on knowledge and understanding. Invariably this has resulted in greater safety and operating efficiency.

![Getting the balance right is crucial when flying a B-25.](../images/weight_and_balance.png "Weight and Balance")

In the loading of heavy bombers this is especially true. Ever-changing tactical requirements, calling for more and more complex combinations of cargo, fuel, crew, and armament, have made any but precise, accurate methods too dangerous to consider. This need to get the utmost in efficiency from every flight highlights the need for precise control of weight and balance.

Improper loading, at best, cuts down the efficiency of an airplane. Maneuverability, rate of climb, speed, and ceiling suffer greatly.

At its worst, it may mean failure to complete a flight, and sometimes failure even to start a flight, in most cases with a loss of life and destruction of valuable equipment.

## Overload {#sect_Overload .section}

![Do not overload the B-25, or structural failure may result.](../images/weight_overload.png "Structural failure")

1.  Causes higher stalling speeds.
2.  Lowers structural safety Limits.
3.  Reduces maneuverability.
4.  Increases length of the takeoff run.
5.  Lowers the angle and rate of climb.
6.  Decreases ceiling.
7.  Increases fuel consumption for a given speed.
8.  Overloads the tires.

## Center of Gravity Too Far Forward {#sect_NoseTooHeavy .section}

![Ensure that the B-25 is not nose heavy.](../images/weight_nose_heavy.png "Nose heavy")

1.  Increases dives beyond control.
2.  Causes unstable, nose-down tendencies when flaps are lowered.
3.  Increases difficulty in raising nose on landing.
4.  Overloads nosewheel and tire.
5.  Increases pilot strain in instrument flying.
6.  Dangerous if tail structure is damaged.

## Center of Gravity Too Far Aft {#sect_CGTooFarAft .section}

![Ensure that the B-25 is not tail heavy.](../images/weight_tail_heavy.png "Tail heavy")

1.  Increases stall tendency.
2.  Limits low power operation.
3.  Decreases speed.
4.  Decreases range.
5.  Increases pilot strain in instrument flying.
6.  Dangerous if tail structure is damaged.
