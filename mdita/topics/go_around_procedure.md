# Go-Around Procedure {#go_around_procedure .task}

Don't hesitate to go around. Any doubt that the plane is under perfect control is sufficient cause to go around. If you have made a poor approach and know that the landing will be too long, or too rough—go around.

**Do the following:**

1.  Keep the prop set at 2400 rpm.

2.  Advance the power smoothly to climbing power.

3.  Keep the nose of the plane down.

4.  Raise landing gear.

5.  Raise the flaps to 15°

6.  Allow the plane to settle to a slightly lower altitude, if necessary, to maintain or increase the airspeed.

    With the plane trimmed for landing there is a strong tendency for the nose to lift when power is applied. This will throw the plane into a stall if it is not counteracted.

7.  When the plane has gained sufficient airspeed to lift and gain altitude, pull over to one side of the runway, thus clearing the runway for any plane attempting to take off or land.

    **Important:** Keep an eye on all planes near you! The pilot taking off under you may not know that you are there.

8.  As soon as you gain sufficient speed, raise the balance of your flaps. Establish a normal climb, break traffic, reenter traffic as before and make a normal landing.

    **Note:** Don't hesitate to go around. Any doubt that the plane is under perfect control is sufficient cause to go around. If you have made a poor approach and know that the landing will be too long, or too rough&\#8212; go around.
