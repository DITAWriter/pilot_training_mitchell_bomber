# Preventing Spontaneous Combustion {#preventing_spontaneous_combustion .concept}

A good, clean airplane prevents spontaneous combustion.

Clean off all oil and gas whenever it gets on, or in, a plane. Oily rags, etc., must not be allowed to accumulate. To combat such fires close off the compartment in which they are started and use your hand extinguishers.

Electrical failures and shorts may cause fires. Soâ€”if the seat of your electrical pants should start to smoke, take out the plug, take off the pants, and put out the fire.

Remove fuses from inverters, dynamotors, and instruments whenever the fire is localized.

On late-series planes automatic circuit breakers replace the fuses. Excessive heat breaks the electrical contacts and disconnects the source of trouble.

**If flames are visible do not reset the cut-outs.**

To combat fire caused by enemy action use the techniques described above, depending, of course, on where they start.
