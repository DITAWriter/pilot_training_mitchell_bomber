# Power-On Landings {#power_on_landings .concept}

Before turning onto the base leg, one landing is much like another. The variations in procedure start as you leave the downwind leg.

Before turning onto the base leg, one landing is much like another. The variations in procedure start as you leave the downwind leg.

## Normal landing procedure {#sect_NormalLanding .section}

The first of the techniques discussed is a normal landing procedure.

Turn onto the base leg and make your final radio check unless the tower has given other instructions. Play the turn into the runway from the base leg to allow a straight approach.

When you are lined up, lower the flaps full down and di\*op the nose to a point short of the runway, Adjust the power and glide angle to keep the nose traveling along a line that would, if not corrected, put the nose of your plane squarely on the point you have selected. Maintain a predetermined speed all through the approach and to the point at which your roundout starts. This gliding speed varies with the load, but on most planes it is from 120 to 130 mph.

Adjust the trim tabs to ease the load on the controls. Keep the speed constant and the nose on the point, thus setting up a constant glide path. As you approach the runway, flare off and reduce the power and speed. When over the runway, hold the throttles completely closed to prevent them from creeping open and stretching the glide.

Land in a tail-low attitude. Make contact with the main wheels touching down at the same time. The landing gear is designed to absorb great loads if they are applied straight ahead. Tremendous thrust is generated in landing, and if it is applied in a side thrust it can easily collapse the gear.

The landing speed depends on your skill and on weight conditions.

Hold the nosewheel in the air with the elevators, thus reducing the length of the landing roll. The increased angle of attack of the wings, plus the 45" of flaps, acts as an air brake.

**Lower the nosewheel slowly with elevator control as you lose airspeed on the landing roll.** Do not allow the nosewheel to drop heavily onto the runway. It was not designed to absorb this type of load.

**Never use the brakes when the nosewheel is off the ground.** This throws the nosewheel to the ground suddenly and will collapse it, seriously damaging the airplane. Keep your heels on the floor to avoid unintentional braking.

## Power-On landing procedure {#sect_NightLanding .section}

The second technique for power-on landing is a procedure for use at night, under strong wind conditions, or whenever you want more positive control. In this you fly the airplane all the way to the ground.

Set the approach in exactly the same manner as for the first technique.

As you approach the runway, reduce the power at a point farther out from the end of the runway. Reduce power gradually, slowing the pUne as you come in. The use of power lowers your stall speed and the speed must be low to prevent overshooting the runway.

As you reach the end of the runways your speed should be slightly above the power-off stalling speed, with the plane in a landing attitude. Now reduce power slowly until the plane settles onto the ground. Close the throttles completely only when the plane is on the ground.

**Don't make a dragging approach in this type of landing.**

This is not a short-field landing—there is no place in it for slow flying. The plane is never below power-off stall speed until it is over the runway. The maneuver is designed to give you maximum control of the airplane. You lose this advantage if you do not execute it properly.

The remainder of the ground roll and landing check are identical with the first procedure.

## Combat landing procedure {#sect_CombatLanding .section}

The third technique is commonly called a combat landing. It is the product of combat theatres, where the difference between life and death is often the amount of time it takes you to get out of the traffic pattern and onto the ground.

A slow-flying bomber with wheels and flaps down is a setup for any fighter which spots it.

This is a precision maneuver requiring a lot of skill and judgment.

Fly the downwind leg in the same way as the two other power-on landing techniques. The rest of the procedure is entirely different.

When you are opposite the end of the runway on your downwind leg, start a turn into the field.

Play your speed and altitude in a constantly descending turn. Lower your flaps in the turn so that they will be full down as you roll out above the runway.

Properly executed, you can complete this roll-out just above the end of the runway at a speed that permits the minimum amount of float above the runway before touching down.

If you visualize a chandelle and then reverse it so that you picture a diving turn through 180°, you have an accurate picture of this landing.

CAUTION:

This maneuver requires the touch and skill of an experienced pilot. Have an instructor pilot demonstrate it to you and practice it when he is present. The rest of the landing procedure is identical with the others.
