Information on all of the remaining emergency equipment, including the alarm bells, life raft and life preservers, emergency fuel pump, pyrotechnic signal pistol the radio demolition switch, hand ax, first-aid kits and fire extinguishers.

## Alarm Bells {#sect_AlarmBells .section}

The alarm bells are located at all crew stations. A switch on the lower left section of the pilot's switch panel controls them.

## Life Raft {#sect_LifeRaft .section}

A life raft equipped with a CO2 cylinder for instantaneous inflation is stowed in the upper forward left corner of the radio compartment. For proper use, see ditching.

## Life Preservers {#sect_LifePreservers .section}

The back cushions on the pilot's and copilot's seats are filled with kapok and will serve as life preservers.

## Emergency Fuel Pump {#sect_EmerFuelPump .section}

In late-series airplanes there is an emergency fuel transfer hand pump on the floor of the navigator's compartment. If the electric fuel system fails, you can transfer fuel from the bomb bay tanks to the wing tanks with this pump.

## Pyrotechnic Signal Pistol {#sect_PyroSignalPistol .section}

On later planes, an M-8 type pyrotechnic pistol is stowed in a canvas holster in the navigator's compartment as loose equipment.

**Warning:** Don't load this pistol except when it has been placed in the mount provided in the upper left corner of the navigator's compartment.

## Radio Demolition Switch {#sect_RadioDemoSwitch .section}

On later airplanes, a switch controlling the charge for demolishing the identification radio in an emergency is on the right instrument sub-panel. Depress both buttons simultaneously to set off the charge.

## Hand Ax {#sect_HandAx .section}

There is a hand ax on the right side of the fuselage in the radio operator's compartment.

## First-Aid Kits {#sect_FirstAidKits .section}

Two first-aid kits are provided, one on the left side of the navigator's compartment, the other on the right side of the radio compartment. The number of kits is often increased when the ship engages in tactical operation.

## Fire Extinguishers {#sect_FireExtinguishers .section}

Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers are at the right side of the navigator's compartment and at the right side of the radio operator's compartment.

There is an engine fire extinguisher system for both engines. It is controllable from the copilot's station. A safety fuse for indicating a premature discharge is on the right side of the fuselage above the nosewheel.
