# Dives {#dives .concept}

The diving characteristics of the B-25, like all its flight characteristics; are exceptionally good. The first thing for you to remember, as a new pilot in the B-25, is this: the plane is not a dive bomber.

It was designed and built to carry a load of bombs to a target and return to its base. The fact that the plane can exceed these minimum requirements is no excuse to abuse it.

The red-lined diving speed on the B-25 is 340 mph. This maximum speed is possible only under definite weight limits.

Recover from a dive gradually. The structural load on the airplane increases in direct relation to the abruptness of the pullout.

Be careful if you dive the plane in rough air, because the roughness increases the load and shock forces the plane must carry.

Combat requirements may force you to dive the plane when the gross weight is excessive. The plane will carry you through some tight spots in an emergency, but treat it gently. Don't place unnecessary loads on the plane by rough and careless handling.
