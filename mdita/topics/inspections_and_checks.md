# Inspections and Checks {#inspections_and_checks .concept}

You have a very personal reason for wanting to know that your airplane is in the best possible condition for a flight.

That reason is you. If anything happens to the plane, it also happens to you and your crew.

Use your checklists. You are entrusted with the lives of a highly trained crew and valuable equipment. The plane and its crew are your only business while you are its pilot.

There are too many controls which must be set properly, too many instruments and indicators to be checked, to allow for any but the most definite procedures, always systematically planned and executed.

These checks and inspections will not take a lot of your time. When proficient, you can check and inspect the whole plane thoroughly in the time you usually waste for lack of a definite procedure.

Consult the crew chief about the status of the plane. You will pick up many of valuable tips from him.

## Preflight {#sect_Preflight .section}

Enter cockpit and check that all switches are "OFF"

Check Form lA for status of the airplane. Surface controls locked. Trim tabs set at "0."

Pull props through 12 to 15 blades if the airplane has been standing for more than 30 minutes. This will work the oil from the lower cylinders.

If you start the engine with excess oil present in the cylinders this oil will form a pressure block, cracking the cylinder heads and bending the connecting rods.

Always pull the props through in the direction of rotation. Otherwise fuel and oil will be forced back into the intake section. This will cause an unknown and possibly dangerous fuel-air ratio and make starting difficult.

## Nose Section {#sect_NoseSection .section}

Bombardier's escape hatch unlocked. Check bombardier's compartment for proper stowage.

Shimmy damper pin \(⅜-inch extension\). Nosewheel towing lockpin engaged—Red acorn-nut covering this pin must be in place and secure. Rotate clockwise until hand-tight. The towing lockpin locks the nosewheel into position. \(The cover will not engage if this pin is unlocked.\)

Nosewheel oleo strut for proper clearance.

![Preflight nosewheel oleo strut for proper clearance](../images/preflight_nosewheel.png)

Tires for cuts, wear, blisters, slippage, and proper inflation.

Ground tire on nosewheel for contact with ground.

Nosewheel door for proper fitting and tension \(40 lb.\). Spring tension closes this door when the airplane is in flight. If it closes improperly the slipstream forces it open, and the resulting air blast may tear it of! and damage other parts of the airplane.

Nose hood locked and safetied \(B-25 G, H, and TB-25\).

Check engine fire extinguisher fuse if installed.

## Right Engine Section {#sect_RightEngineSection .section}

Carburetor air scoop cover removed.

Propeller for nicks, propeller dome and governor for leaks.

Check pulleys, cables, and safety wires.

Colws, cowl flaps, and Dzus fasteners secure—a loose cowl section can be a serious hazard in flight.

Exhaust stacks, fingers, gaskets and studs, for looseness and cracks.

Oil sump magnetic plugs safetied.

Oleo strut \(extension 2⅞ inches\), brake lines for leaks, torque arm scissors, main wheel down-lock engaged.

Tire for cuts, bruises, excessive wear, slippage, and proper inflation.

![Preflight tire](../images/preflight_tire.png)

Battery jar in nacelle for proper servicing.

Wheel chocks in place.

Gasoline drain plugs properly safe tied.

## Right Wing Section {#sect_RightWingSection .section}

De-icer boots for cuts, tears, worn spots, and proper installation.

Pitot head cover removed.

![Preflight, remove pitot head cover](../images/preflight_pitot_head_cover.png)

Wing surfaces for wrinkles, dents, or loose rivets. This is an important check. Wrinkles in the metal surface indicate excessive strain.

Control surfaces for general condition.

Trim tabs neutral at "0" settings.

## Empennage {#sect_Empennage .section}

Check for wrinkles, dents, loose rivets, de-icer installation.

Trim tabs neutral at "0" settings.

## Rear Compartment {#sect_RearCompartment .section}

Loading and stowage—In the photographer's compartment sections of the control cables are exposed on the sidewalls of the fuselage. Check the stowage carefully at this point; a loose cord, parachute buckle, or any loose equipment entangled in the controls may cause them to freeze.

Emergency escape hatches unlocked. Emergency landing-gear and flap lowering mechanisms stowed.

Trailing antenna fully retracted. Entrance hatch closed and latched.

## Left Wing Section {#sect_LeftWingSection .section}

Repeat the right engine section inspection. Check left nacelle for stowage of the hand energizer.

## Bomb Bay {#sect_BombBay .section}

Check doors for looseness. Check gasoline lines and plugs for leaks. Check bomb bay for strong gasoline odors. Note: Turn booster pumps "ON" before making this check.

## General {#sect_General .section}

![General preflight inspection](../images/preflight_general.png)

Check visually the amount of fuel in each tank.

Check fuel caps for proper installation.

Check visually the amount of oil in tanks and see that caps and Dzus fasteners are secure.

Check life raft storage compartment release handle "LOCKED."

Crew briefing—Location and operation of escape hatches.

Proper use of parachutes.

Abandon-ship procedure and signals.

Escape hatches—Emergency operation. Check with crew chief to determine the time of the last check on the emergency operation of the escape hatches.

Testing and operation of oxygen equipment-check crew on knowledge of proper usage. \(Consult your Pilots' Information File.\)

Interphone operation.

## Navigator's Compartment {#sect_NavCompartment .section}

![Preflight emergency air brake pressure](../images/preflight_emer_air_brake_press.png)

Emergency air brake pressure \(550-600 lb. sq. in.\).

Nosewheel pawl "OFF" handle stowed. The cable on this system moves as the nosewheel is raised and lowered. If the engaging pawl is "ON" the movement of the nosewheel will tear the cable out of the system. \(On later-series aircraft, hydraulic emergency systems replace this type. When you operate ships with these installed, safety the handle "UP."\)

Brake accumulator pressure 400 lb. sq. in. minimum.

Hydraulic accumulator pressure 400 lb. sq. in. minimum.

Oxygen pressure \(where applicable\).

![Preflight crossfeed and cut-off valves](../images/preflight_valves.png)

Crossfeed "OFF."

Fuel transfer valve and switches "OFF." Right and left engine fuel cut-off valves "ON"

Generators and inverters "ON"—External power should be used whenever possible. If external power is not available for starting, keep inverters "OFF" until engine is operating.

Level of Hydraulic fluid reservoir \(spare fluid aboard\).

Cabin heaters "OFF."

![Preflight cabin heaters to "OFF"](../images/preflight_cabin_heaters.png)

Check the load and balance of the ship. Check Form F with the load adjuster. The B-25 carries great loads and is unstable and dangerous if the weight is not properly distributed. \(For detailed information, see the [PIF](../glossentries/gl_PIF.md) and the Weights and Balance section of this manual.\)

## Cockpit {#sect_Cockpit .section}

Have your parachute fitted to your body and always wear it.

An improperly fitted chute will cause serious physical injury—protect yourself.

Adjust seat and belt—If the seat is not locked the acceleration of takeoff will force the seat away from the controls. You cannot reach the controls properly even for taxiing if the seat is not forward and locked.

Escape hatch unlocked, hatch secure.

Controls unlocked, check for free and proper movement. This insures the release of the lock, and reveals the presence of obstructions to free movement of the controls.

Parking brakes "SET." Brake pressure 500 lb. sq. in. minimum.

![Preflight parking brakes](../images/preflight_parking_brakes.png)

![Check controls for free and proper movement](../images/preflight_controls.png)

Hydraulic selector "NORMAL." Air brake handle down and safetied. Landing gear handle "DOWN" and locked. Wing flaps up, controls neutral. Cowl flaps open, controls neutral. Set all hydraulic controls except landing gear at neutral when they are not in use; this prevents loss of fluid and pressure in the entire system if part of it fails.

Automatic pilot "OFF" and locked. Supercharger "LOW BLOWER" and locked. All takeoffs must he made in "LOW BLOWER." Any attempt to do otherwise robs the engines of power.

Oil shutters as required. Carburetor heat "NORMAL"

![Preflight throttles](../images/preflight_throttles.png)

Throttles cracked \(V2 inch to 1 inch\).

Propellers "INC. RPM."

Mixture "IDLE CUT-OFF."

Radios "OFF."

De-icers "OFF."

Airspeed selector "STATIC."

Altimeter set \(station elevation\). This setting will enable you to check the radioed altimeter setting and detect any scale error in your altimeter.

![Preflight gyros](../images/preflight_gyros.png)

Gyros "UNCAGED."

![Preflight battery](../images/preflight_battery.png)

Battery-disconnect switches "ON" \(unless external power is used\). Light switches as required.

![Preflight fuel](../images/preflight_fuel.png)

Check fuel levels—the visual preflight check acts as a check on the instrument reading.
