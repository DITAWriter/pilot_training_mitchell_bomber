# Post-Landing Checklist {#post_landing_checklist .task}

On the runway, move the prop control to "INC. RPM."

When the plane has slowed, complete this landing check:

1.  Booster Pumps "OFF."

2.  Cowl Flaps "OPEN."

3.  Wing Flaps "UP."


Clear the runway quickly, freeing it for the next plane to land.
