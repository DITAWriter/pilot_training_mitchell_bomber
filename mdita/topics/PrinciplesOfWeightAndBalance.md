# Principles of weight and balance {#PrinciplesOfWeightAndBalance .concept}

Understanding proper balance and the center of gravity of a B-25, and how to correctly determine the total weight and its distribution on board the aircraft.

## Proper Balance {#section_l1v_zdv_3gb .section}

An airplane is properly balanced when it will remain approximately level if suspended from a definite point within its center of gravity range.

## Center of Gravity Range {#section_nlp_12v_3gb .section}

The center of gravity range is the maximum fore-and-aft limits within which the balance of the airplane's weight must lie if the plane is to fly safely. This center of gravity range is near the leading edge of the wing where the maximum lift occurs.

## Balancing the B-25 {#section_uc1_b2v_3gb .section}

Balancing the B-25 is simply a matter of distributing the weight so that the center of the airplane's loaded weight falls within the center of gravity range.

## Weighing the B-25 {#section_f1n_b2v_3gb .section}

The B-25 is weighed to determine the basic weight of the airplane and to find the point at which this weight is balanced.

## Charts and Forms {#section_plz_b2v_3gb .section}

There are various charts and forms for controlling the weight and balance of the B-25. These may be found in T.O, Ol-lB-40. For information on these charts and forms consult your weight and balance officer or T.O. Ol-lB-40.

## Form F {#section_l5j_c2v_3gb .section}

The Form F vitally concerns the pilot. This is the record of the distribution of weight in the airplane, it will tell you the CG step by step as each item is placed in the plane.

**You must fill out this Form F before every flight.** One copy is filed and one copy remains in the *Weight and Balance Handbook* of the plane.

For instructions on the use of the load adjuster see the [PIF](../glossentries/gl_PIF.md) or T.O. Ol-lB-40.
