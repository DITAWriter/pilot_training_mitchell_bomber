The role of the two types of gunners on your airplane.

Your gunners belong to one of two distinct categories: turret gunners and flexible gunners.

The power turret gunners must have good coordination.

While the flexible gunners do not require the same delicate touch as the turret gunner, they must have a fine sense of timing.

All gunners should be familiar with the coverage area of all gun positions, and be prepared to bring the proper gun to bear on the target.

They must be experts in aircraft identification.

They must be thoroughly familiar with the machine guns. They should know how to maintain the guns, how to clear jams and stoppages, and how to harmonize the sights with the guns.

During training flights, the gunners should be in their turrets, tracking with the guns even when actual firing is not practicable. Other aircraft flying in the vicinity offer excellent tracking targets, as do automobiles, houses, and other ground objects during low-altitude flights.

Keep your gunners' interest alive at all times. Any form of competition among the gunners themselves should stimulate their interest.

Finally, each gunner should fire the guns at each station to familiarize himself with the other positions.
