# Starting Engines {#starting_engines .task}

Use the checklist for starting.

 

 

1.  Fire guard posted.

2.  Props clear.

3.  Ignition switches "ON" one at a time Booster pumps "ON"—operate only the switch on the engine you are starting.

4.  Energize 10 seconds when using an external power source, 20 seconds when using the plane's batteries.

5.  Prime—Use primer for 2 seconds while energizing. This is not a priming action; it merely fills the primer lines with fluid and allows instant priming when the engine is engaged.

6.  Engage—Hold down energizer, primer and engaging switch until the engine starts. Mesh for reasonable time. If engine does not fire, repeat starting procedure.

7.  Check oil pressure—\(40 lb. in 30 seconds\). If the oil pressure does not reach 40 lb. in 30 seconds stop the engine and investigate.

8.  Repeat procedure on the left engine.

9.  Booster pumps "OFF"—check fuel pressure. There must be 6-7 lb. sq. in.

10. Warm up at approximately 1200 rpm.

11. Battery-disconnect switches "ON" \(if external power is used\).

12. Hydraulic pressure—\(800-1100 lb. sq. in.\).

13. Brake pressure—\(1000-1200 lb. sq. in.\).

14. Suction—\(3,75-4.25" Hg.\).

15. Radio "ON."

16. If the engine backfires and excess fuel in the intake section catches fire, move the mixture control to "IDLE CUT-OFF" and advance the throttles to full open.

    Keep the engine turning over with the starter if the fire is small. Keep the throttles open wide and the mixture in "IDLE CUT-OFF" until the fire burns out. If the fire continues to burn, flaring out of the air scoop and the cowl flaps » turn the engine fuel cut-off valve "OFF" and use the hand extinguisher \(CO2\) on the base of the flame. Always keep the throttles open wide to exhaust all the fuel that can reach the engine. If this fails, use the Lux system if it is installed in the airplane. When you encounter fires of this type and have used the Lux system, do not attempt to restart the engine. If in attempting to restart the engine you start another fire, you will have no positive means of extinguishing the flames.

17. Don't try to rush the warming of the engines during the warm-up period. The R-2600 engines have a great mass of metal in them, and the warm-up must be thorough. Some parts of the engines will warm up while other parts are still cold. Many engines have been ruined by improper warm-up.

18. Watch cylinder-head temperatures closely during warm-up, as the engine temperature rises more quickly in operation at idling settings on the ground than at high power settings in the air. There are pressure baffles on this plane, and very little air can flow around the cylinder heads when the plane has no forward speed.
