# Single Engine Practice {#single_engine_practice .concept}

Remember that you are trimmed for single engine flight at one airspeed only. If the airspeed or power setting is changed you must re-trim.

On a practice flight try this: Trim the plane for a speed of 160 or 170 mph. Then advance or retard the throttle. Allow the plane to fly itselfâ€”it will immediately start hunting a stable flight condition. It will turn, climb, and dive all over the sky, finally falling into a spiral or spin if you do not take over the controls.

Now return the controls to the power setting for which you are trimmed. Hold the plane manually until the airspeed returns to its proper setting. The airplane will again fly hands off.

Now for the single engine turns. The old theory that you must never turn into the dead engine is false. You can turn in either direction. If you can make a good coordinated turn into The good engine you can do the same thing into the dead engine.

![It is possible to do a turn with a dead engine if you are making the turn in the direction of the dead engine](../images/single_eng_turn_into_dead_eng.png "A turn into the dead engine is OK")

Practice some turns in both directions. You will find no difference as long as the airspeed is constant. Lose a slight amount of altitude in the turn to keep the airspeed constant. Do not blast roughly on the throttles to maintain airspeed. This is a dangerous fault, leading to loss of control when carried too far.

Steep turns on a single engine are not necessary. The weight of the plane increases rapidly as the angle of bank increases, and as no benefit is derived from steep turns, it is foolhardy to try them when full power is not available.
