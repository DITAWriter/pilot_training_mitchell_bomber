# Engine Failure on Takeoff {#engine_failure_on_takeoff .task}

This is a tricky proposition for any pilot to handle. When the engine fails before you gain CSE speed, retract the wheels and land straight ahead. There is far less danger in a belly landing than in attempting to go around with too low an airspeed.

If you are in the air, however, and have CSE speed, you can go around without too much difficulty.

You must know your procedure and your airplane Work quickly, accurately, and efficiently. **Don't get panicky.**

Don't get featheritis—be sure the engine is out, not just spitting a little.

Use the same procedure, but notice that the first three parts of it are already accomplished.

1.  **Airspeed**—You either have CSE speed or you land straight ahead.

2.  **Directional Control**—This is an instinctive reaction. Use rudder pressure at the first feel of yaw.

3.  **Increase power**—Takeoff power has already been applied. It may be necessary to reduce power to maintain control.

4.  **Reduce Drag.**

    1.  Raise the wheels

    2.  Feather the prop

    3.  Raise flaps to 15 degrees

    4.  Close cowl flaps on dead engine

    5.  Drop weight if necessary

5.  **Reduce Fire Hazard**.

6.  **Trim**.

7.  **Trouble Search**.
