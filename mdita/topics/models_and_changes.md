# Models and Changes {#models_and_changes .concept}

Combat problems in several theaters of war found the A, B, C, and D models of the B-25 unsuited for certain tactical operations. A series of modifications were necessary to overcome these problems.

The B-25 was originally designed for medium-altitude bombing, but combat theaters found it maneuverable and fast, making it suitable for low-altitude bombing and strafing missions. Additional firepower, armor plating, and re-arrangement of equipment were necessary to equip the B-25 for this type mission.

The B-25G, basically a modified C or D, has a 75-mm. cannon and additional forward-firing **.50-cal. guns**. The B-25G carries no bombardier; therefore the pilot operates bombing mechanisms and all forward-firing guns. Later models of the B-25G have additional firepower. Waist guns and a tail stinger, with more armor plating for the crew, make the B-25G a 4-fisted menace to enemy shipping and ground installation.

The B-25H, which followed the B-25G, underwent several changes to make it an even more formidable weapon. With the 75-mm. cannon still part of the equipment, four .50-cal. forward-firing guns were installed in the nose, and four .50-cal. blister guns, two on each side of the fuselage, were added.

With no bombardier aboard, the pilot does all the bombing and fires all forward-firing guns. The upper turret has been moved from the rear of the plane to the navigator's compartment, giving it a more effective arc of fire. Two .50-cal. waist guns, one on each side of the fuselage just aft of the bomb bay, are operated by the radio gunner. A tail turret provides two more **.50-cal. guns**. The B-25H, primarily used for low-altitude attack, has fourteen .50-cal. machine guns and one 75-mm. cannon in addition to its complete bombardment equipment.

The B-25J is designed to operate as a medium altitude bomber and at the same time to provide sufficient firepower for low-altitude strafing missions. With no cannon aboard, the nose is reconverted into a bombardier's compartment with the addition of two forward-firing **.50-cal. guns**. One fixed **.50-cal. gun** and one flexible **.50-cal. gun** in the bombardier's compartment-plus the four forward-firing blister guns give the pilot highly effective firepower. The rest of the firepower is identical with that of the B-25H. One excellent feature of the B-25J is the dual bombing controls, giving the pilot or the bombardier individual control of all bombing equipment. With twelve **.50-cal. guns**, it is one of the deadliest medium bombers in operation.
