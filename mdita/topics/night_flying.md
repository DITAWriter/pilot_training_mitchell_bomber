# Night Flying {#night_flying .task}

The technique of night flying is closely akin to instrument flying.

A few tips on night flying:

**Important:** In night flying, a turn may suddenly change contact flight to instrument flight. Be ready to fly instruments at any moment.

1.  Know the location of your controls.

2.  Always carry a flashlight.

3.  Use extra care in taxiing.

4.  Use landing lights **alternately** for taxiing, except in very congested areas.

5.  Use the extension light rather than the dome light for reading maps and charts.

6.  Check all lighting equipment and fluorescent lighting of instrument panel before leaving the ground.

7.  Make an accurate check of your flight instruments.

8.  Switch on the dome light if your eyes feel strained during prolonged instrument flight at night. This creates the illusion of flying under a hood and relieves strain.
