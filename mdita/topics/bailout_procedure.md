1.  When you decide that the ship must be abandoned, give the alarm by interphone and alarm bell, at which time the engineer and rear gunner release the emergency doors.

2.  The first warning informs the crew that they must prepare to bail out.

3.  The second warning is an order to the crew to jump. As each crew member gets ready to leave the plane, he advises you by interphone that he is leaving.

4.  The order in which the crew leaves the plane is as follows:

    Forward Hatch:

    1.  Engineer
    2.  Bombardier-navigator
    3.  Copilot
    4.  Pilot
    Rear Hatch:

    1.  Gunner
    2.  Radio operator.
