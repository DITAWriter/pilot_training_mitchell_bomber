# Common Taxiing Errors {#common_taxiing_errors .concept}

A short list of what not to do when taxiing.

**Riding the brakes.** Depress the toe pedals only when necessary.

**Rough braking action.** Avoid this by anticipating the need for brakes.

**Rough or no use of the throttles.**

**Improper use of the rudders.** There is a common tendency to forget that there are rudders. When the runway and taxi strip are clear, let the plane roll free and control with rudders.

**Failure to clear the area.** This is the cause of most taxi accidents. There is no excuse for taxi accidents.

**Fast taxiing in congested areas.**

**Turning with the inside wheel not moving.**
