# Heating System {#heating_system .concept}

The airplane has two independent heating systems; one for heating the navigator's, pilot's, and bombardier's compartments, the other for heating the radio operator's compartment and the interior of the fuselage aft of it.

Each of these two systems has a Stewart-Warner heater burning a mixture of fuel and air. The forward heating system will operate only when the left engine is running, and the aft system only when the right engine is running.

The heater for the forward system is in the left wing center section and a system of hot air ducts leads forward along the left wall of the fuselage. The pilot may obtain more air at high altitude and slow airspeed by operating the air flow control at the left side of his seat. The air travels from the intake scoop on the leading edge, through the heaters, to valve equipped outlets in each forward compartment.

Controllable cold air scoops are provided for the pilot, copilot, and bombardier.

**Do not open any of the three escape hatches during flight to obtain ventilation.** The drag these open hatches create lowers the efficiency of the plane and in some flight attitudes will cause unstable flight characteristics,

A direct control for the aft heater system, mounted on the heater itself, is just aft of the lower turret on the left wall of the radio operator's compartment.

There is also a master control switch on the pilot's switch panel for emergency use and to aid the pilot in keeping the heater off during takeoff and landing. The flexible tube leading from the blower and heater unit heats the interior of either the upper or lower turret.

The heating and ventilating system is designed so that you can always obtain hot or cold air when either heater is on or off, respectively, by opening air outlets in the compartment. The temperature of the air is regulated by the air temperature control in the navigator's compartment, which sets the heater in operation and governs its heat output. Both the air temperature control and the pilot's air flow control regulate the heating and defrosting air simultaneously.

The first movement of the heater control in the radio operator's compartment actuates a micro-switch turning the heater igniter on and starting the blower. Additional movement of the control opens the heater throttle for additional heat output.

The heater in the left wing center section will automatically shut off its heating chamber if it becomes too hot, and will restart when the temperature lowers.

If the temperature in the wing compartment that contains the heater becomes too high, the heater will automatically shut off but will not restart until it has been serviced.

**Warning:** When taking off or landing, in order to have full power available, heating system must be off.
