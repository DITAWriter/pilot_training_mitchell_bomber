# Anti-Icing {#anti_icing .concept}

Emergency provision is made to prevent ice formation on the propellers, and on the bombsight window by an alcohol anti-icing system.

The alcohol anti-icing system has two supply tanks, one in each engine nacelle against the outboard wall They carry isopropyl alcohol. The tank in the right-hand nacelle has a capacity of 10 gallons and supplies fluid through separate line systems for anti-icing of the propeller blades and the bombardier's window. A standpipe reserves 1.5 gallons for the bombsight window after the supply for the propellers is exhausted. The tank in the left-hand nacelle is used for carburetor de-icing. It is similar to the one in the right nacelle except that special inter-rib recesses on the outboard side increase the capacity to 15 gallons. Each system has its own pump, filters, and check valves to keep the fluid readily available near the point of application and to prevent draining of the fluid during dives.

There is no fluid level gage inside the airplane. The fluid level is checked by means of overflow plugs mounted on the tank.

## Propeller Anti-icing {#sect_PropAntiIcing .section}

Conventional slinger rings are provided for the propellers. A fluid metering pump in the right-hand nacelle forward of the tank is controlled by a rheostat on the pilot's switch panel with a slight turn to the right, the control operates the pump at its maximum speed. Further rotation of the control to the right reduces the speed of the pump to any desired volume. The pump is capable of supplying from .36 to 3.17 gallons per hour to each propeller ring.

Whenever icing conditions are encountered, start the pump immediately in order to supply sufficient fluid to coat propeller surfaces before ice formation if possible. However, if ice has already formed—as indicated by rough engine performance —turn the rheostat to fast-flow position until the ice has been removed and the engines run smoothly. Then turn the rheostat to a position which will supply sufficient fluid to prevent further ice formation. Use the fluid as sparingly as possible. Remember that the capacity of the supply tanks is only 10 gallons. Keep in mind the length of time you may have to use the pump and the fact that the fluid in the reservoir must also be kept available for anti-icing the bombardier's window. During missions on which the bomb window anti-icing system is not needed, the fluid supply in the reservoir is sufficient for 1 hour and 20 minutes' continual operation with the rheostat turned to the fast-flow position. At the minimum flow setting, the supply will last for 11 hours and 48 minutes.

## Bombsight Window {#sect_BombsightWindow .section}

The bombardier's compartment window has perforated anti-icing tubes across the top of the center panel, plus a vertical wiper assembly. Fluid for the spray tube comes from the same tank used for the operation of the propeller anti-icer. The available supply includes the 1.5 gallons reserved by the standpipe within this tank. A rheostat control mounted forward of the instrument panel on the left side of the bombardier's compartment regulates fluid flow.

The check valve in the fluid supply line to the bomb window tubes is in the compartment ceiling and is readily available to the bombardier should minor adjustments be necessary during flight. Turning the visible screw to the right restricts the rate of flow.

The electric motor which drives the windshield wiper through a flexible cable assembly is controlled by two switches in the lower left corner of the box control panel. The first switch may be set to "FAST" or "SLOW" and the motor turned "ON" by means of the second switch. To prevent injury to the motor or the wiper, the switch must not be turned "ON" while the bomb window is dry.

The installation of this equipment precludes the use of a pilot's windshield spray. A field service installation may, however, be made on these aircraft to provide a clear-vision windshield. This is a 6-ply, chemically treated glass window. The outboard sections are in a neutral pressure area and may be removed in extreme icing conditions to provide direct vision ahead.
