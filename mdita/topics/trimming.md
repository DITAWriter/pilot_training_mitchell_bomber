# Trimming {#trimming .task}

When properly trimmed the B-25 flies with an ease that belies its weight and size.

Watch an old instructor pilot at the controls and you will see that he practically flies the plane with the trim tabs.

Learning to trim a plane properly and to detect quickly when it is out of trim boosts your ability as a pilot.

Every change of attitude, airspeed, and power settings, causes a corresponding change in pressures on the controls. If the trim tabs are not adjusted for the varying pressures, the resulting physical strain tires the strongest man in a surprisingly short time.

**Always Keep the B-25 in trim**

To execute any maneuver properly, you must keep the airplane in trim. Exercise particular care in setting the trim tabs on takeoff.

Improperly set tabs make control difficult as the speed and lift increase during the takeoff run.

1.  Keep the wings level by visual reference or by instruments.

2.  Trim rudder until ball is centered or until directional gyro stops turning.

3.  Trim aileron

4.  Trim elevator

Check the trim by releasing all controls, allowing the plane to fly for a short time without guidance. Properly trimmed it holds course, altitude, and heading for some time.

Some planes are difficult to trim properly. This is a result of improper rigging and you cannot correct it while in the air. If you encounter this difficulty, check the trim and the weight and balance of the plane to see that it is properly loaded. After assuring yourself that it is the plane and not the pilot, report this condition on the Form lA.

The engineering officer will run a check flight on the plane. His findings may result in the re-rigging of the plane and subsequent improvement in its flying characteristics.
