Equipment and Instruments
=========================

This section provides a survey of the key systems, equipment and
instrumentation of the [B-25]{.keyword} airplane.

-   **[Power Plant](../mdita/power_plant.md)**\
    The [B-25]{.keyword} is powered by two Wright Cyclone R-2G00-13 or
    R-2G00-29, 14-cylinder, double-row radial engines.
-   **[Air Induction System](../mdita/air_induction_system.md)**\
    Air enters the induction system through air scoops above the
    nacelle. The ram action of the air mass supplies the energy to move
    cold air through the system.
-   **[Fuel System](../mdita/fuel_system.md)**\
    Each engine has an independent fuel supply, interconnected by fuel
    transfer and fuel crossfeed systems. The fuel lines and cells are
    self-sealing.
-   **[Oil System](../mdita/oil_system.md)**\
    Each engine has an independent oil supply. The self-sealing oil tank
    mounted behind the firewall on each nacelle has a capacity of 34
    gallons.
-   **[Dual Ignition System](../mdita/dual_ignition_system.md)**\
    The ignition system, except for the induction vibrator coil, is
    independent of all other electrical power sources.
-   **[Electrical System](../mdita/electrical_system.md)**\
    The electrical power which operates and controls the various units
    of the [B-25]{.keyword} is supplied by 2 generators, supplemented by
    2 storage batteries connected in parallel.
-   **[B-25 Lighting
    Equipment](../mdita/b_25_lighting_equipment.md)**\
    Locations of the exterior and interior lighting systems.
-   **[Hamilton Hydromatic
    Propellers](../mdita/hamilton_hydromatic_propellers.md)**\
    The Hamilton hydromatic propellers of the [B-25]{.keyword} are
    hydraulically operated.
-   **[Hydraulic System](../mdita/hydraulic_system.md)**\
    The hydraulic system provides quick and easy operation of the
    following equipment on the [B-25]{.keyword}.
-   **[Landing gear](../mdita/LandingGear.md)**\
    The [B-25]{.keyword} has retractable, tricycle landing gear,
    hydraulically operated.
-   **[Instruments](../mdita/instruments.md)**\
    The following instruments are installed on the [B-25]{.keyword}. You
    need no special instructions for their operation, as they are
    basically the same as those on any 2-engine bombardment or training
    airplane.
-   **[Automatic Pilot](../mdita/automatic_pilot.md)**\
    Most [B-25]{.keyword} aircraft have A-3 or A-3A autopilots which
    operate on a pneumatic-hydraulic principle. They fly the airplane
    automatically in straight and level flight and make the necessary
    corrections for holding a given course or altitude.
-   **[Communication
    Equipment](../mdita/communication_equipment.md)**\
    Location and types of communication equipment located throughout the
    [B-25]{.keyword}.
-   **[Armament](../mdita/armament.md)**\
    The armament of the [B-25]{.keyword} follows basically the same
    pattern found in any AAF bombardment airplane. The detailed
    installation varies greatly according to the tactical uses intended.
-   **[Oxygen](../mdita/oxygen.md)**\
    The [B-25]{.keyword} has two systems of oxygen supply. The first is
    a permanent installation in the early-series aircraft, the second a
    portable system in later-series [B-25]{.keyword} aircraft.
-   **[Photographic Equipment](../mdita/photographic_equipment.md)**\
    There is a photography station in the fuselage rear section on
    early-model airplanes.
-   **[Models and Changes](../mdita/models_and_changes.md)**\
    Combat problems in several theaters of war found the A, B, C, and D
    models of the [B-25]{.keyword} unsuited for certain tactical
    operations. A series of modifications were necessary to overcome
    these problems.
-   **[Comparison Equipment
    Chart](../mdita/comparison_equipment_chart.md)**\
    Key differences for the equipment load-out for the different
    variants of the [B-25]{.keyword}.
-   **[Fuel System Operation](../mdita/fuel_system_operation.md)**\
    Every man on your crew must know the fuel system so thoroughly that
    a mistake in its operation is impossible.
-   **[Operating Instructions for the
    Supercharger](../mdita/operating_instructions_for_the_supercharger.md)**\
    The supercharger is an integral part of your engine at all
    altitudes.
-   **[Carburetor Air Heat](../mdita/carburetor_air_heat.md)**\
    The carburetor air heater on the [B-25]{.keyword} is a 2-position
    gate in the air induction system.
-   **[Carburetor Air Filter](../mdita/carburetor_air_filter.md)**\
    The true relationship between the effects of the carburetor air
    filter and engine power output.
-   **[Priming](../mdita/priming.md)**\
    Priming is necessary to supply a sufficiently rich fuel air mixture
    to the cylinder heads to facilitate starting of a cold motor.
-   **[Operating the
    Autopilot](../mdita/operating_the_autopilot.md)**\
    How and when to operate \"Elmer\", the autopilot.
