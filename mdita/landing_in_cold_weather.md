Landing in Cold Weather
=======================

 {.body .conbody}
Practical tips on what to know when landing your [B-25]{.keyword} in
cold weather flying conditions.

Temperature inversions are common in winter and the ground air may be
15째 to 30째C colder than at altitude. Therefore, take care to avoid
excessive cooling when letting down. Lower the landing gear and use
flaps to reduce airspeed while descending. Retain considerable power,
and if possible, maintain oil temperature above 20째C and cylinder-head
temperatures above 150째C. Lower readings than these may result in the
engines cutting out or the failure of the engines to respond when the
throttles are advanced.

Before approaching for a landing, make sure ice is not jamming the
carburetor throttle valve. Test by moving throttle back and forth
several times. You may have to use carburetor heat on the approach.
