Emergency Fuel Pump {#emergency-fuel-pump .title .sectiontitle}
-------------------

In late-series airplanes there is an emergency fuel transfer hand pump
on the floor of the navigator\'s compartment. If the electric fuel
system fails, you can transfer fuel from the bomb bay tanks to the wing
tanks with this pump.

Carbon dioxide fire extinguishers are at the right side of the

premature discharge is on the right side of the fuselage above the
nosewheel.
