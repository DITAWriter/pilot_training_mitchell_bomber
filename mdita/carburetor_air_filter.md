Carburetor Air Filter
=====================

 {.body .conbody}
The true relationship between the effects of the carburetor air filter
and engine power output.

The false impression exists among some pilots and mechanics that the
carburetor air filter affects airplane performance.

Installation of a filter is merely equivalent to closing the throttles
slightly. This means that for all altitudes less than critical, where
manifold pressure limits prevent full throttle opening, the filter has
no effect at all on engine power output or airplane performance.

Manifold pressure gives the best indication of engine power output, and
at a given pressure the engine develops the same power regardless of
whether a filter is installed. The only time that removal of the filter
benefits performance is when the throttle is full open and still more
manifold pressure is permissible.

When the filter is installed, it affects only cold ram air. Heated air
does not pass through the filter element.
