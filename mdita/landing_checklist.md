Landing Checklist
=================

 {.body .taskbody}
On any landing, enter traffic as instructed by field regulations or as
instructed by the control tower.

 {.section .section .context}
Adjust the power settings to bring the speed below 170 mph but not below
150 mph. Prior to landing, make this landing check:

 {.note .important .note_important}
[Important:]{.note__title} Do not allow the speed to drop below 150 mph
until you are on the approach.



1.  [Trailing antenna \"RETRACTED\".]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Wing deicers \"OFF\".]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Heaters \"OFF\".]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Autopilot \"OFF\".]{.ph .cmd}
5.  [Fuel pressure.]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [Fuel levels.]{.ph .cmd}
7.  [Booster pumps \"ON\".]{.ph .cmd}
8.  [Transfer pumps \"OFF\".]{.ph .cmd}
9.  [Mixture \"FULL RICH\".]{.ph .cmd}
10. [Carburetor heat \"NORMAL\" except in severe icing conditions.]{.ph
    .cmd}
11. [Propellers 2400 rpm--- This permits the use of maximum climbing
    power in the event of a go-around. (See power control charts.)]{.ph
    .cmd}
12. [Landing gear \"DOWN\"---locked and safetied, visually and orally
    checked.]{.ph .cmd}

    You can check the main gear visually and the nose gear on the selsyn
    indicator, and, if the prop hub is polished, you can check it by its
    reflection in the hub. There is a warning horn in some aircraft and
    a warning light in later models. This warning system operates when
    the throttles are retarded.
    

13. [Brake and hydraulic pressure.]{.ph .cmd}
14. **Optional:** [Optional with local regulations, you may use 15° of
    flaps on the downwind leg to improve visibility and to improve
    handling characteristics at low speeds.]{.ph .cmd}
