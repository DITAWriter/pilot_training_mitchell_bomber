3.  [Ignition switches \"ON\" one at a time Booster pumps \"ON\"---
    operate only the switch on the engine you are starting.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Energize 10 seconds when using an external power source, 20 seconds
    when using the plane\'s batteries.]{.ph .cmd}
5.  [Prime---Use primer for 2 seconds while energizing. This is not a
    priming action; it merely fills the primer lines with fluid and
    allows instant priming when the engine is engaged.]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [Engage---Hold down energizer, primer and engaging switch until the
    engine starts. Mesh for reasonable time. If engine does not fire,
    repeat starting procedure.]{.ph .cmd}
7.  [Check oil pressure---(40 lb. in 30 seconds). If the oil pressure
    does not reach 40 lb. in 30 seconds stop the engine and
    investigate.]{.ph .cmd}
8.  [Repeat procedure on the left engine.]{.ph .cmd}

9.  [Booster pumps \"OFF\"--- check fuel pressure. There must be 6-7 lb.
    sq. in.]{.ph .cmd}
10. [Warm up at approximately 1200 rpm.]{.ph .cmd}
11. [Battery-disconnect switches \"ON\" (if external power is
    used).]{.ph .cmd}
12. [Hydraulic pressure--- (800-1100 lb. sq. in.).]{.ph .cmd}
13. [Brake pressure--- (1000-1200 lb. sq. in.).]{.ph .cmd}
14. [Suction--- (3,75-4.25\" Hg.).]{.ph .cmd}
15. [Radio \"ON.\"]{.ph .cmd}
16. [If the engine backfires and excess fuel in the intake section
    catches fire, move the mixture control to \"IDLE CUT-OFF\" and
    advance the throttles to full open.]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
    Keep the engine turning over with the starter if the fire is small.
    Keep the throttles open wide and the mixture in \"IDLE CUT-OFF\"
    until the fire burns out. If the fire continues to burn, flaring out
    of the air scoop and the cowl flaps Â» turn the engine fuel cut-off
    valve \"OFF\" and use the hand extinguisher (CO~2~) on the base of
    the flame. Always keep the throttles open wide to exhaust all the
    fuel that can reach the engine. If this fails, use the Lux system if
    it is installed in the airplane. When you encounter fires of this
    type and have used the Lux system, do not attempt to restart the
    engine. If in attempting to restart the engine you start another
    fire, you will have no positive means of extinguishing the flames.
    

17. [Don\'t try to rush the warming of the engines during the warm-up
    period. The R-2600 engines have a great mass of metal in them, and
    the warm-up must be thorough. Some parts of the engines will warm up
    while other parts are still cold. Many engines have been ruined by
    improper warm-up.]{.ph .cmd}
18. [Watch cylinder-head temperatures closely during warm-up, as the
    engine temperature rises more quickly in operation at idling
    settings on the ground than at high power settings in the air. There
    are pressure baffles on this plane, and very little air can flow
    around the cylinder heads when the plane has no forward speed.]{.ph
