Training {#training .title .sectiontitle}
--------

1.  Tell your crew the purpose of each mission and what you expect each
    to accomplish.
2.  **Keep the crew busy throughout the flight.** Get position reports
    from the navigator; send them out through the radio operator. Put
    the engineer to work on the cruise control and maximum range charts.
    Require the copilot to keep a record of engine performance. Give
    them a workout. Encourage them to use their skill. A team is an
    active outfit. Make the most of every practice mission.
3.  Practice all emergency procedures as often as possible--- bailout,
    ditching and fire drill.

    when on oxygen.
