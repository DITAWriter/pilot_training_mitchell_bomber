Short-Field Landings
====================

 {.body .conbody}
You have all heard a lot of discussion on the importance of accurate
short-field landings. Combat requires that you be able to operate under
conditions that are close to the absolute limit of the airplane\'s
performance.

But even at home, if you took off this afternoon and the hydraulic
system failed in flight, you would have a perfect example of the
necessity for short-field landings in everyday flying. You would have to
make an accurate short-field landing to be sure that there was ample
room to stop with the emergency air brake.

Short-field landings are necessary where:

1.  The field is unobstructed but small.
2.  The runways are blocked by obstacles, power lines, trees, etc.

Training in short-field landings improves your technique and builds up
confidence for normal landings.

Short-field landings are closely related to power-on full-flap stalls
and power-off, full-flap stalls, with the gear down.

Practice slow flying before trying this type of landing. The technique
is as follows:

For the field without obstructions:

1.  Place the base leg farther from the field than normal.
2.  Establish a normal full-flap glide.
3.  **Undershoot the field.**
4.  Hold the usual speed to the roundout and gradually pull up the nose,
    increase the power and go directly into slow flying.

Since no obstruction is present, do this close to the ground, enabling
you to land almost immediately when the power is cut.

As you approach the desired point of landing, reduce power. Since the
plane is in a landing attitude and approaching the power-off stalling
speed as you reduce power, you must land almost immediately.

A maximum use of brakes is permissible in this type of landing.

 {.note .remember .note_remember}
[Remember:]{.note__title} You are deliberately flying toward a chosen
point of landing at approximately power-off stalling speed. When power
is cut, you must be ready to land.


For the field with obstructions:

The type of approach you just made is obviously impractical for this
landing.

1.  Establish a normal full-flap power glide.
2.  Plan this glide to clear the obstruction with power, Don\*t depend
    on your judgment from too high an altitude.
3.  Control the attitude of the plane to gain a level or slightly
    nose-high attitude as you clear the obstruction.
4.  Reduce the airspeed to slightly above the power-off stalling speed.

As the obstacle is cleared , use power in accordance with the height of
the obstacle. Place the plane in a tail-low attitude and use the
throttles to control the rate of descent. Do not reduce power too
quickly or the plane will drop in for a hard and dangerous landing.

 {.note .caution .note_caution}
[CAUTION:]{.note__title} Do not use a dragging approach. Study the
diagrams carefully and use them in your planning.


Maintain at all times on the approach a speed not less than the
power-off stalling speed of your plane. The exaggerated attitude of the
[B-25]{.keyword} at lower speeds makes recovery difficult.

In this type of maneuver, don\'t cut your power suddenly. The plane
stops flying and starts falling when the power is completely cut. If the
power is reduced gradually, the airplane slowly settles down to a soft,
short landing.

Maximum use of brakes is permitted on this maneuver.

This procedure is used by airline and military pilots where field
conditions make it imperative. Pilots use it often in tactical flying.
Its sole purpose is to approach the field at the lowest safe airspeed
and land accurately as soon as the power is cut.

If you lack sufficient feel of the airplane to do this, practice slow
flying, stalls, and this type of approach at a safe altitude before it
is used.

Common Errors: {#common-errors .title .sectiontitle}
--------------

-   Excessive speed on the approach.
-   Crossing the obstruction too high and landing longer than necessary.
-   Slow flying from traffic altitude to the ground.
-   Cutting power upon crossing the obstacle regardless of altitude, and
    dropping in. This is extremely dangerous with the B-25.
-   Poor coordination of throttle and airspeed.
