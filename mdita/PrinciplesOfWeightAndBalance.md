Principles of weight and balance
================================

 {.body .conbody}
Understanding proper balance and the center of gravity of a
[B-25]{.keyword}, and how to correctly determine the total weight and
its distribution on board the aircraft.

 {#PrinciplesOfWeightAndBalance__section_l1v_zdv_3gb .section .section}
Proper Balance {#proper-balance .title .sectiontitle}
--------------

An airplane is properly balanced when it will remain approximately level
if suspended from a definite point within its center of gravity range.


 {#PrinciplesOfWeightAndBalance__section_nlp_12v_3gb .section .section}
Center of Gravity Range {#center-of-gravity-range .title .sectiontitle}
-----------------------

The center of gravity range is the maximum fore-and-aft limits within
which the balance of the airplane\'s weight must lie if the plane is to
fly safely. This center of gravity range is near the leading edge of the
wing where the maxi- mum lift occurs.

Balancing the [B-25]{.keyword} {#balancing-the-b-25 .title .sectiontitle}
------------------------------

Balancing the [B-25]{.keyword} is simply a matter of distributing the
weight so that the center of the airplane\'s loaded weight falls within
the center of gravity range.


 {#PrinciplesOfWeightAndBalance__section_f1n_b2v_3gb .section .section}
Weighing the [B-25]{.keyword} {#weighing-the-b-25 .title .sectiontitle}
-----------------------------

The [B-25]{.keyword} is weighed to determine the basic weight of the
airplane and to find the point at which this weight is balanced.


 {#PrinciplesOfWeightAndBalance__section_plz_b2v_3gb .section .section}
Charts and Forms {#charts-and-forms .title .sectiontitle}
----------------

There are various charts and forms for controlling the weight and
balance of the [B-25]{.keyword}. These may be found in T.O, Ol-lB-40.
For information on these charts and forms consult your weight and
balance officer or T.O. Ol-lB-40.


 {#PrinciplesOfWeightAndBalance__section_l5j_c2v_3gb .section .section}
Form F {#form-f .title .sectiontitle}
------

The Form F vitally concerns the pilot. This is the record of the
distribution of weight in the airplane, it will tell you the CG step by
step as each item is placed in the plane.

**You must fill out this Form F before every flight.** One copy is filed
and one copy remains in the Weight and Balance Handbook of the plane.

For instructions on the use of the load adjuster see the PIF or T.O.
Ol-lB-40.
