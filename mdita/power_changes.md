Power Changes
=============

 {.body .conbody}
What to know about expected engine performance when throttling up.

Always make power changes smoothly and evenly. This engine will not
absorb a sudden blast of power without acting up. Move the controls
slowly and smoothly to the desired settings rather than attempting to
make one swift movement and pick up the proper settings.

![Reduce
rpm](../images/power_reduce_rpm.png){#power_changes__image_dpx_1hs_cgb
.image width="288"}\

If the rpm is reduced first, you get a jump in manifold pressures. This
causes detonation if the relation of the rpm to manifold pressure is
altered greatly.

An engine running at constant power settings uses a constant amount of
fuel and air. If the rpm is reduced, this fuel-air supply remains almost
constant, and an engine running at reduced speed cannot absorb this
fuel-air charge. Pressures in the impeller and cylinder heads rise as a
result and cause detonation.

![Advance
throttles](../images/power_advance_throttles.png){#power_changes__image_pdg_fhs_cgb
.image width="288"}\

As engines pick up speed the manifold pressures drop; this is a normal
and desired reaction. Adjust the throttles and synchronize the engines.

For the proper relation of manifold pressure to rpm see the power
control chart.
