The combat record of the Mitchell has being printed in the newspapers of
all the world for every man to see. Little can be added to that story
except the developments of the future.

You and your buddies will write that story in the skies of the world.

You have been taught to fly the Mitchell accurately and safely under all
conditions. Now you must learn to use the [B-25]{.keyword} as a weapon,
for that is the ultimate purpose of military flying.

All the skill and determination you can bring to this job will be none
too much. How well you learn to punish the enemy and to protect yourself
will in the final analysis determine whether you are a successful pilot.

The [B-25]{.keyword} has been used for every purpose that need has
demanded. Bombing, strafing, torpedoing, and even the evacuation of
wounded, are listed in her duty roster. Whatever the need, the
[B-25]{.keyword} was either ready or quickly converted to do the job.

Her primary duties have been many:

-   Bombing, both low and medium altitude.
-   Strafing, with cannon and machine gun.
-   Smoke missions.
-   Gunnery, both for defensive and offensive fire.

The following pages illustrate the duties and responsibilities which are
yours when using the [B-25]{.keyword} as a weapon. They are typical of
the actual orders and instructions issued to [B-25]{.keyword} crews in
training for combat duty.

Preparing for Your Mission {#preparing-for-your-mission .title .sectiontitle}
--------------------------

Before a mission is undertaken, the entire crew will be briefed. Upon
completion of the mission the entire crew will again report to the S-2
officer for interrogation.

As commander of your airplane, it is your duty to brief your crew before
the flight, pointing out to each crew member the specific duties he is
expected to perform.

 {.section .section}
Additional Information {#additional-information .title .sectiontitle}
----------------------

The clock system will be used in reporting position of other aircraft
seen in flight.

The pilot of an airplane on an individual flight or the leader of a
formation flight will make it standard procedure to contact all radio
ranges en route to give a position report, and in case of doubtful
weather to receive a weather report especially at the field of intended
landing.

On cross-country flights, either the armorer-gunner, radio-gunner, or
the engineer-gunner will be in the turret at all times.

On low altitude missions, pilot will not fly below altitude specified as
minimum for the particular mission being flown.

On all low altitude missions, course will be corrected to avoid flying
over towns, cities, and thickly inhabited rural areas.
