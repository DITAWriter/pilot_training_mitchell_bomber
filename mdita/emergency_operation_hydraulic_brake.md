Before landings if there is less than 1000 lb. pressure indicated on the
brake system pressure gage:



1.  [Turn hydraulic selector valve to \"BRAKE.\"]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Operate the hand pump until indicator shows 1000 lb. sq. in.
    minimum and no more than 1450 lb. sq. in.]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Operate continuously while landing and taxiing as the initial
    pressure in the accumulator is insufficient for normal landing.]{.ph
    .cmd}
4.  [If, on landing, you cannot maintain sufficient pressure, use the
    emergency air brake system.]{.ph .cmd}
5.  [If you cannot build up 600 lb. pressure in the accumulator, pick a
    field with at least a one-mile runway, land and use the air brake
    system.]{.ph .cmd}
     {.itemgroup .info}
    Always make a short-field landing when your brake pressure is low.
