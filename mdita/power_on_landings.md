Before turning onto the base leg, one landing is much like another. The
variations in procedure start as you leave the downwind leg.

Normal landing procedure {#normal-landing-procedure .title .sectiontitle}
------------------------

The first of the techniques discussed is a normal landing procedure.

Turn onto the base leg and make your final radio check unless the tower
has given other instructions. Play the turn into the runway from the
base leg to allow a straight approach.

When you are lined up, lower the flaps full down and di\*op the nose to
a point short of the runway, Adjust the power and glide angle to keep
the nose traveling along a line that would, if not corrected, put the
nose of your plane squarely on the point you have selected. Maintain a
predetermined speed all through the approach and to the point at which
your roundout starts. This gliding speed varies with the load, but on
most planes it is from 120 to 130 mph.

Adjust the trim tabs to ease the load on the controls. Keep the speed
constant and the nose on the point, thus setting up a constant glide
path. As you approach the runway, flare off and reduce the power and
speed. When over the runway, hold the throttles completely closed to
prevent them from creeping open and stretching the glide.

Land in a tail-low attitude. Make contact with the main wheels touching
down at the same time. The landing gear is designed to absorb great
loads if they are applied straight ahead. Tremendous thrust is generated
in landing, and if it is applied in a side thrust it can easily collapse
the gear.

The landing speed depends on your skill and on weight conditions.

![](../images/landing_lower_nosewheel_slowly.png){.image}

Hold the nosewheel in the air with the elevators, thus reducing the
length of the landing roll. The increased angle of attack of the wings,
plus the 45\" of flaps, acts as an air brake.

**Lower the nosewheel slowly with elevator control as you lose airspeed
on the landing roll.** Do not allow the nosewheel to drop heavily onto
the runway. It was not designed to absorb this type of load.

**Never use the brakes when the nosewheel is off the ground.** This
throws the nosewheel to the ground suddenly and will collapse it,
seriously damaging the airplane. Keep your heels on the floor to avoid
unintentional braking.

Power-On landing procedure {#power-on-landing-procedure .title .sectiontitle}
--------------------------

The second technique for power-on landing is a procedure for use at
night, under strong wind conditions, or whenever you want more positive
control. In this you fly the airplane all the way to the ground.

Set the approach in exactly the same manner as for the first technique.

As you approach the runway, reduce the power at a point farther out from
the end of the runway. Reduce power gradually, slowing the pUne as you
come in. The use of power lowers your stall speed and the speed must be
low to prevent overshooting the runway.

As you reach the end of the runways your speed should be slightly above
the power-off stalling speed, with the plane in a landing attitude. Now
reduce power slowly until the plane settles onto the ground. Close the
throttles completely only when the plane is on the ground.

**Don\'t make a dragging approach in this type of landing.**

This is not a short-field landing--- there is no place in it for slow
flying. The plane is never below power-off stall speed until it is over
the runway. The maneuver is designed to give you maximum control of the
airplane. You lose this advantage if you do not execute it properly.

The remainder of the ground roll and landing check are identical with
the first procedure.

 {#power_on_landings__sect_CombatLanding .section .section}
Combat landing procedure {#combat-landing-procedure .title .sectiontitle}
------------------------

The third technique is commonly called a combat landing. It is the
product of combat theatres, where the difference between life and death
is often the amount of time it takes you to get out of the traffic
pattern and onto the ground.

A slow-flying bomber with wheels and flaps down is a setup for any
fighter which spots it.

This is a precision maneuver requiring a lot of skill and judgment.

Fly the downwind leg in the same way as the two other power-on landing
techniques. The rest of the procedure is entirely different.

When you are opposite the end of the runway on your downwind leg, start
a turn into the field.

Play your speed and altitude in a constantly descending turn. Lower your
flaps in the turn so that they will be full down as you roll out above
the runway.

Properly executed, you can complete this roll-out just above the end of
the runway at a speed that permits the minimum amount of float above the
runway before touching down.

If you visualize a chandelle and then reverse it so that you picture a
diving turn through 180Â°, you have an accurate picture of this landing.

 {.note .caution .note_caution}
[CAUTION:]{.note__title} This maneuver requires the touch and skill of
an experienced pilot. Have an instructor pilot demonstrate it to you and
practice it when he is present. The rest of the landing procedure is
identical with the others.
