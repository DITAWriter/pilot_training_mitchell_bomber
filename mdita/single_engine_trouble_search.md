How to troubleshoot issues with a single engine.

1.  [First--- Switch the vacuum selector to the good engine to get
    accurate readings of instruments.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [With the plane under control, try to find out what caused the
    trouble, and, if possible, make temporary repairs. Check all fuses,
    cut-off valves, pop-out switches, lines and wiring as well as you
    can.]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Don\'t try to re-start the engine if you don\'t know what is wrong.
    It is much simpler to make a single engine landing than to fight a
    fire.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Adjust the cowl flaps and the oil cooler shutters as desired.
    Reduce weight if the plane is excessively heavy. Drop bombs, bomb
    bay tank, tools; in fact, anything that will come loose, if
    necessary. Make final adjustments on the trim and power
    setting.]{.ph .cmd}
