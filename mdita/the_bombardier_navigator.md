As a navigator it is the bombardier-navigator\'s job to direct your
flight from departure to destination and return.

As a navigator it is the bombardier-navigator\'s job to direct your
flight from departure to destination and return. He must know the exact
position of the airplane at all times. For you to understand how to get
the most reliable service from your navigator, you must know as much
about his job as possible.

Navigation is the art of determining geographic positions by means of
(a) pilotage, (b) dead reckoning, (c) radio, or (d) celestial
navigation, or any combination of these four methods. By any one or
combination of methods the navigator determines the position of the ah
plane in relation to the earth.

Instrument Calibration {#instrument-calibration .title .sectiontitle}
----------------------

Instrument calibration is an important duty of the navigator. All
navigation depends directly on the accuracy of his instruments. Correct
calibration requires close cooperation and extremely careful flying by
the pilot. Instruments to be calibrated include the altimeter, all
compasses, airspeed indicators, alignment of the astrocompass,
astrograph, and drift meter, and a check on the navigator\'s sextant and
watch.

Pilot-Navigator Preflight Planning {#pilot-navigator-preflight-planning .title .sectiontitle}
----------------------------------

1.  Pilot and navigator must study the flight plan of the route to be
    flown, and select alternate airfields.
2.  Study the weather with the navigator. Know what weather you are
    likely to encounter. Decide what action is to be taken. Know the
    weather conditions at the alternate fields.
3.  Inform your navigator at what airspeed and altitude you wish to fly
    so that he can pre- pare his flight plan.
4.  Learn what type of navigation the navigator intends to use:
    pilotage, dead reckoning, radio, celestial, or a combination of all
    methods.
5.  Determine check points; plan to make radio fixes.
6.  Work out an effective communication method with your navigator to be
    used in flight.
7.  Synchronize your watch with your navigator\'s.

Pilot-Navigator in Flight {#pilot-navigator-in-flight .title .sectiontitle}
-------------------------

1.  Constant course--- For accurate navigation you must fly a constant
    course. The navigator has to make many computations and entries in
    his log. Constantly changing course makes his job more difficult. A
    good navigator should be able to follow the pilot, but he cannot be
    taking compass readings all the time.
2.  Constant airspeed--- Hold IAS as nearly constant as possible. This
    is as important to the navigator as is a constant course in
    determining position.
3.  Precision flying greatly affects the accuracy of the navigator\'s
    instrument readings, particularly celestial readings. A slight error
    in celestial reading causes considerable error in determining
    position. You can help the navigator by providing as steady a
    platform as possible from which to take readings. The navigator
    should notify you when he intends to take readings so that you can
    level off and fly as smoothly as possible, preferably by using the
    automatic pilot. Do not allow your navigator to be disturbed while
    he is taking celestial readings.
4.  Notify the navigator of any change in flight, such as change in
    altitude, course, or airspeed. Before you change your flight plan,
    consult the navigator. Talk over the proposed change so that he can
    plan the flight and advise you concerning it.
5.  If there is doubt about the position of the airplane, consult your
    navigator, refer to his flight log, talk the problem over and decide
    together the best course of action.
6.  Check your compasses at intervals with those of the navigator,
    noting any deviation.
7.  Require your navigator to give position reports at intervals.
8.  You are ultimately responsible for getting the airplane to its
    destination. Therefore, it is your duty to know your position at all
    times.
9.  Encourage your navigator to use as many of the methods of navigation
    as possible for double-checking. In training, give him a chance to
    practice. Follow his courses even though you know he is wrong. Keep
    track of the plane\'s position but allow him to rectify his errors.


 {#the_bombardier_navigator__post-flight_critique .section .section}
Post-flight Critique {#post-flight-critique .title .sectiontitle}
--------------------

After every flight, get together with the navigator and discuss the
flight and compare notes.

Go over the navigator\'s log. If there have been serious navigational
errors, discuss them with the navigator and determine their cause. If
the navigator is at fault, caution him that it is his job to see that
the same mistake does not occur again. If faulty instruments have caused
the error, see that they are corrected before attempting another
navigation mission. If your flying has contributed to the inaccuracy of
the navigation try to fly a better course the next mission.


 {#the_bombardier_navigator__misc_duties .section .section}
Miscellaneous Duties {#miscellaneous-duties .title .sectiontitle}
--------------------

As a member of the team, the bombardier-navigator must also have a
general knowledge of the entire operation of the airplane.

He must be familiar with the oxygen system, know how to operate the
turrets, radio equipment, and fuel transfer system.

He must know the location of all fuses and spare fuses, lights and spare
lights, affecting navigation.

He must be familiar with emergency procedures, such as the manual
operation of landing gear, bomb bay doors, and flaps, and the proper
procedures for crash landings, ditching, bailout, etc.


 {#the_bombardier_navigator__bombardment .section .section}
Bombardment {#bombardment .title .sectiontitle}
-----------

Accurate and effective bombing is the ultimate purpose of your entire
airplane and crew.

Every other function is preparatory to hitting and destroying the
target.

Successful bombardment is the primary goal of the bombardier-navigator.
The success or failure of the mission depends upon what he accomplishes
in that short interval of the bombing run.

A great deal depends on the understanding between bombardier-navigator
and pilot. You expect your bombardier to know his job. He expects you to
understand the problems involved in his job, and to give him full
co-operation. Teamwork between pilot and bombardier is essential.

Under any given set of conditions--- ground speed, altitude, direction,
etc.--- there is only one point in space where a bomb may be released
from the airplane to hit a predetermined object on the ground.

There are many things with which a bombardier must be thoroughly
familiar in order to release his bombs at the right point to hit this
predetermined target.

He must understand his bombsight, what it does, and how it does it.

He must understand the operation and up- keep of his bombing instruments
and equipment.

He must know that his racks, switches, controls, releases, doors,
linkage, etc., are in first-class operating condition.

He must know how to operate all gun positions in the airplane.

He must know how to load and how to clear simple gun stoppages and jams
while in flight.

He must be able to load and fuse bombs.

He must understand the destructive power of bombs and know the
vulnerable spots on various types of targets.

He must understand the bombing problem, bombing probabilities, bombing
errors, etc.

He must be versed in target identification and in aircraft
identification.

The bombardier should be familiar with the duties of all members of the
crew.

To enable the bombardier to do his job, you must place the airplane in
the proper position to arrive at a point from which he can release his
bombs to hit the target.

Unless the pilot performs his part of the bombing run correctly, even
the best bombardier in the world cannot bomb accurately.
