Day Navigation, Photo-Reconnaissance, and Instrument Let-Down Mission
=====================================================================

 {.body .taskbody}
How this mission works and what\'s expected of every crew member.

 {.section .section .context}
This mission will consist of a controlled ground speed day navigation
and photo-reconnaissance mission, at the end of which the pilot will
orient himself by the X Radio Range and simulate a let-down to Home
Base. If first attempt is unsuccessful, a second orientation and
let-down will be accomplished.


**Conduct of Mission:**

1.  [This mission will be briefed by the Squadron S-2. All crew members
    will take careful notes as directed by S-2, and will be interrogated
    upon return as to observation. Oblique and pinpoint photographs will
    be taken. Target maps are available for the localities directed
    below and photographs will be taken of each given target.]{.ph .cmd}

**Specific Duties of Crew Members**

2.  [Pilot--- will aid and direct crew in obtaining observations; give
    careful attention to best photographic procedures; direct
    photographs be taken as briefed; and communicate on interphone at
    all times.]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Copilot--- will take notes on installation noted by himself and
    pilots and accomplish all normal copilot duties.]{.ph .cmd}
4.  [Navigator-Bombardier]{.ph .cmd}
    a.  [Will navigate by DR Navigation on a V-P chart except within 10
        minutes of target area where pinpoint pilotage will be used on a
        sectional chart.]{.ph .cmd}
    b.  [Act as observer and perform duties as briefed by S-2.]{.ph
        .cmd}
    c.  [Maintain and submit navigation log, weather observations, and
        other data to Squadron Navigation Officer.]{.ph .cmd}
5.  [Radio Operator--- will transmit position reports submitted by
    Bombardier-Navigator, and practice tracking from all gun
    positions.]{.ph .cmd}
6.  [Engineer-Gunner--- will perform all normal duties and also act as
    observer.]{.ph .cmd}
7.  [Armorer-Gunner--- will preflight and in- stall photo equipment;
    take photos as directed by pilot; make observations of ground
    activity; and man battle station at all times, taking careful
    observations and reporting to the pilot all aircraft and ground
    installations sighted.]{.ph .cmd}
