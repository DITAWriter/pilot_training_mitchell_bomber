# IFF {#gl_IFF .glossentry}

IFF stands for Identification, Friend or Foe.

IFF is a radar-based identification system designed for command and control. It uses a transponder that listens for an interrogation signal and then sends a response consisting of a unique signal that identifies the broadcaster. It enables military and civilian air traffic control interrogation systems to identify aircraft, vehicles or forces as friendly and to determine their bearing and range from the interrogator. \(From Wikipedia\).
