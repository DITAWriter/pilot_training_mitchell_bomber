Dealing with Engine Fires
=========================

 {.body .taskbody}
Formerly a great many fires started in the carburetor.

 {.section .section .context}
At present, because of the many improvements in carburetion, few engine
fires start in this manner. The most common cause today is the
mechanical failure of some part.

To combat a carburetor fire:


1.  [Cut off gas to the engine.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [Mixture control in \"IDLE CUT-OFF.\"]{.ph .cmd}
3.  [Throttle full forward.]{.ph .cmd}

 {.section .section .result}
This quickly empties the carburetor and exhausts the fuel that is
burning. In most cases no other action need be taken.
