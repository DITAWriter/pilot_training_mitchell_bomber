Takeoff in Cold Weather
=======================

 {.body .taskbody}
Short checklist on what to look for when attempting to take off during
cold weather conditions.

takeoff.\

1.  [Never take off if there is any snow, ice, or frost on the wings.
    Even the thinnest layer of frost may cause loss of lift and
    treacherous stalling characteristics. In extreme conditions it may
    be necessary to taxi out to the takeoff position before removing the
    protective covers from the flight surfaces.]{.ph .cmd}
2.  [In ordinary operation, carburetor air controls should be in
    \"NORMAL\" for takeoff. In extremely cold weather, however, it is
    often advisable to place carburetor air control in \"ICING\" during
    takeoff to insure proper fuel vaporization.]{.ph .cmd}

    [Note:]{.note__title} (You will seldom find these extreme conditions
    in the continental United States. In arctic zones, consult
    experienced pilots before employing this procedure.)
