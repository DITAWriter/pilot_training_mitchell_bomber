A DITA-fied version of the Pilot Training Manual for the Mitchell Bomber B-25

This project converted the original Pilot Training Manual for the Mitchell Bomber (B-25) to DITA 1.3, designed to provide a sample aviation document that has been optimized using DITA best practices. 

The original version of the document can be found on the Archive.org website at https://archive.org/details/PilotTrainingManualForTheMitchellBomber. 

Some of the things this manual will showcase when complete:
- implement a keystore containing keys of commonly-used features *DONE*
- a key-based image repository *DONE*
- a separate keystore for holding key terms *DONE*
- addition of glossary entries *DONE*  
- common phrases rendered in conkeyrefs *DONE*  
- topics fully indexed *DONE* 
- fully accessible images utilizing the desc and alt elements *DONE*  
- fully accessible tables using @rowheader *DONE*  
- short descriptions for every topic *DONE*
- relationship tables for the contents of each chapter *DONE*
- sample multimedia files inserted into appropriate topics: takeoff.dita, landing.dita, single_engine_landing.dita, raising_the_wheels_once_airborne.dita, and starting_engines.dita *DONE*
 
At the time of writing (December 2019) this project is now content- and image-complete.  

If you notice any issues or typos in the content, either send me an email (keith@ditawriter.com), or feel free to fix it yourself.  

Much thanks to Scott Hudson and Eliot Kimber for their considerable contributions to this project.
