# pilot_training_mitchell_bomber
A DITA-fied version of the Pilot Training Manual for the Mitchell Bomber B-25

This is an ongoing project to convert the original Pilot Training Manual for the Mitchell Bomber (B-25) to DITA 1.3, designed to provide a sample aviation document that has been optimized using DITA best practices.

Some of the things this manual will showcase when complete:
- implement a keystore containing keys of commonly-used features *DONE*
- a key-based image repository *DONE*
- common phrases rendered in conrefs
- include acronym elements to spell out inline terms 
- topics fully indexed *DONE* 
- keyword elements to be used in an appendix
- fully accessible tables and images
- short descriptions for every topic *First two chapters*
- relationship tables for the contents of each chapter *DONE*

At the time of writing (February 2018) this project is now content- and image-complete, but still has some way to go. 

Much thanks to Scott Hudson and Eliot Kimber for their considerable contributions to this project.
