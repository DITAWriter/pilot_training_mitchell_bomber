A DITA-fied version of the Pilot Training Manual for the Mitchell Bomber B-25

This is a placeholder for a version of the original Pilot Training Manual for the Mitchell Bomber (B-25) that will be converted over to DITA 1.3.
Some of the things this manual will showcase:
- provide a sample avaiation document based in DITA
- implement a keystore containing keys of commonly-used features
- a key-based image repository
- include acronym elements to spell out inline terms
- keyword elements to be used in an appendix

At the time of writing (December 2018) this project is in the early stages, and not yet ready for prime time. Watch this space!
