        <p>Energize 10 seconds when using an external power source, 20 seconds when using the
            plane's batteries.</p>
        <p>Prime&#8212; Use primer for 2 seconds while energizing. This is not a priming action; it
            merely fills the primer lines with fluid and allows instant priming when the engine is
            engaged.</p>

            Mesh for reasonable time. If engine does not fire, repeat starting procedure.</p>
        <p>Move mixture control to "<userinput>FULL RICH</userinput>" when engine starts.</p>
        <p>Check oil pressure&#8212; (40 lb. in 30 seconds).</p>
        <p>If the oil pressure does not reach 40 lb. in 30 seconds stop the engine and
            investigate.</p>

        <p>Booster pumps "<userinput>OFF</userinput>"&#8212; check fuel pressure. There must be 6-7

        <p>Radio "<userinput>ON</userinput>."</p>
        <p>If the engine backfires and excess fuel in the intake section catches fire, move the
            mixture control to "<userinput>IDLE CUT-OFF</userinput>" and advance the throttles to
            full open.</p>
        <p>Keep the engine turning over with the starter if the fire is small. Keep the throttles
            open wide and the mixture in "<userinput>IDLE CUT-OFF</userinput>" until the fire burns
            out.</p>
        <p>If the fire continues to burn, flaring out of the air scoop and the cowl flaps Â» turn the
            engine fuel cut-off valve "<userinput>OFF</userinput>" and use the hand extinguisher
                (CO<sub>2</sub>) on the base of the flame. Always keep the throttles open wide to
            exhaust all the fuel that can reach the engine.</p>
        <p>if this fails, use the Lux system if it is installed in the airplane. When you encounter
            fires of this type and have used the Lux system, do not attempt to restart the engine.
            If in attempting to restart the engine you start another fire, you will have no positive
            means of extinguishing the flames.</p>
        <p>Don't try to rush the warming of the engines during the warm-up period. The R-2600
            engines have a great mass of metal in them, and the warm-up must be thorough. Some parts
            of the engines will warm up while other parts are still cold.</p>
        <p>Many engines have been ruined by improper warm-up.</p>
        <p>Watch cylinder-head temperatures closely during warm-up, as the engine temperature rises
            more quickly in operation at idling settings on the ground than at high power settings
            in the air.</p>
        <p>There are pressure baffles on this plane, and very little air can flow around the
            cylinder heads when the plane has no forward speed.</p>
