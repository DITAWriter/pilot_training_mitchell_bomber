                    the throttles to full open.</cmd>
                <info>Keep the engine turning over with the starter if the fire is small. Keep the
                    throttles open wide and the mixture in "<userinput>IDLE CUT-OFF</userinput>"
                    until the fire burns out. If the fire continues to burn, flaring out of the air
                    scoop and the cowl flaps Â» turn the engine fuel cut-off valve
                        "<userinput>OFF</userinput>" and use the hand extinguisher (CO<sub>2</sub>)
                    on the base of the flame. Always keep the throttles open wide to exhaust all the
                    fuel that can reach the engine. If this fails, use the Lux system if it is
                    installed in the airplane. When you encounter fires of this type and have used
                    the Lux system, do not attempt to restart the engine. If in attempting to
                    restart the engine you start another fire, you will have no positive means of
                    extinguishing the flames.</info>

                <cmd>Don't try to rush the warming of the engines during the warm-up period. The
                    R-2600 engines have a great mass of metal in them, and the warm-up must be
                    thorough. Some parts of the engines will warm up while other parts are still
                    cold. Many engines have been ruined by improper warm-up.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Watch cylinder-head temperatures closely during warm-up, as the engine
                    temperature rises more quickly in operation at idling settings on the ground
                    than at high power settings in the air. There are pressure baffles on this
                    plane, and very little air can flow around the cylinder heads when the plane has
                    no forward speed.</cmd>
