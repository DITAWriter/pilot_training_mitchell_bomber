    <title>Oil Dilution After Landing in Cold Weather</title>
    <shortdesc>To obtain sufficient dilution of the oil to facilitate starting, allow the engine to
        cool either by idling or stopping after flight, before dilution begins.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>This will prevent rapid evaporation of the gasoline and insure that the viscosity of the
            oil has been reduced sufficiently. In most cases you will find that the engines have
            cooled sufficiently for dilution by the time the airplane reaches the flight line.</p>
        <p>Dilute the engines at 1000 rpm for the time indicated below, consistent with the lowest
            expected air temperature.</p>

            more than ¾ full.</note>
        <p>At the completion of the above dilution period, run both engines up to 1700 rpm,
            continuing dilution, and with propellers in full "INC. RPM" feather and un feather
            each propeller through one complete cycle. Operate each propeller governor through one
            complete cycle. Release dilution switch and decrease engine speed. Stop engines and
            install engine covers.</p>
