        <p>The copilot is the executive officer&#8212; your chief assistant, understudy, and strong
            right arm.</p>
        <p>He must be familiar enough with every one of your duties&#8212;both as pilot and as
            airplane commander&#8212;to take over and act in your place at any time.</p>
        <p>He must be able to fly the airplane under all conditions as well as you would fly it
            yourself.</p>
        <p>He must be proficient in engine operation and know instinctively what to do to keep the
            airplane flying smoothly, even though he is not handling the controls.</p>
        <p>He must have a thorough knowledge of cruising control data and know how to apply his
            knowledge at the proper time.</p>
        <p>He is also the engineering officer aboard the airplane, and maintains a complete log of
            performance data.</p>
        <p>He must be able to fly good formation in any assigned position, day or night.</p>
        <p>He must be qualified to navigate by day or at night by pilotage, dead reckoning, and by
            use of radio aids.</p>
        <p>He must be proficient in the operation of all radio equipment in the pilot's
            compartment.</p>
        <p>In formation flying, he must be able to make engine adjustments almost automatically.</p>
        <p>He must be prepared to assist on instruments when the formation is climbing through an
            overcast, so you can watch the rest of the formation.</p>
        <p>Remember that the more proficient your co-pilot is as a pilot, the better able he is to
            perform the duties of the vital post he holds as your second in command.</p>
        <p>Be sure that he is always allowed to do his share of the flying, in the copilot's seat,
            on take- offs, landings, and on instruments.</p>
        <p>Bear in mind that the pilot in the right-hand seat of your airplane is preparing himself
            for an airplane commander's post too. Allow him every chance to develop his ability and
            to profit by your experience.</p>
