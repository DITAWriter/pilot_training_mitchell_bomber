                <cmd>Check your free air temperature gage before any flight where ice is
                    anticipated.</cmd>

            <step>
                <cmd>After taking off from snow or slush-covered fields, operate the landing gear
                    and flaps through several cycles to insure against the gear and flaps freezing
                    in the up position.</cmd>

            <step>
                <cmd>Turn the pitot tube heater "<userinput>ON</userinput>" when moisture is
                    present. Pitot tube heat should not be applied until the airplane is on the
                    takeoff run or actually in the air, as there is insufficient cooling in the
                    pitot head while the plane is stationary.</cmd>
                <info>
                    <note>With pitot tube heat "<userinput>ON</userinput>" your magnetic compass may
                        oscillate as much as 15Â°.</note>
