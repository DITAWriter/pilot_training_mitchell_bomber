    <title>Go-Around Procedure</title>
    <shortdesc>Don't hesitate to go around. Any doubt that the plane is under perfect control is
        sufficient cause to go around. If you have made a poor approach and know that the landing
        will be too long, or too rough&#8212; go around.</shortdesc>

                        lift when power is applied. This will throw the plane into a stall if it is
                        not counteracted.</p>

                    over to one side of the runway, thus clearing the runway for any plane
                    attempting to take off or land.</cmd>
