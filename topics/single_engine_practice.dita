    <title>Single Engine Practice</title>
    <shortdesc>Remember that you are trimmed for single engine flight at one airspeed only. If the
        airspeed or power setting is changed you must re-trim.</shortdesc>

        <p>On a practice flight try this: Trim the plane for a speed of 160 or 170 mph. Then advance
            or retard the throttle. Allow the plane to fly itself&#8212;it will immediately start
            hunting a stable flight condition. It will turn, climb, and dive all over the sky,
            finally falling into a spiral or spin if you do not take over the controls.</p>
        <p>Now return the controls to the power setting for which you are trimmed. Hold the plane
            manually until the airspeed returns to its proper setting. The airplane will again fly
            hands off.</p>
        <p>Now for the single engine turns. The old theory that you must never turn into the dead
            engine is false. You can turn in either direction. If you can make a good coordinated
            turn into The good engine you can do the same thing into the dead engine.</p>

            <alt>A turn into the dead engine is OK</alt>
        </image>
        <p>Practice some turns in both directions. You will find no difference as long as the
            airspeed is constant. Lose a slight amount of altitude in the turn to keep the airspeed
            constant. Do not blast roughly on the throttles to maintain airspeed. This is a
            dangerous fault, leading to loss of control when carried too far.</p>
        <p>Steep turns on a single engine are not necessary. The weight of the plane increases
            rapidly as the angle of bank increases, and as no benefit is derived from steep turns,
            it is foolhardy to try them when full power is not available.</p>
