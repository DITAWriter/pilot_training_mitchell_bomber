    <title>Tactical Uses of the B-25</title>
    <shortdesc/>
    <conbody>
        <p>The combat record of the Mitchell has being printed in the newspapers of all the world
            for every man to see. Little can be added to that story except the developments of the
            future.</p>
        <p>You and your buddies will write that story in the skies of the world.</p>
        <p>You have been taught to fly the Mitchell accurately and safely under all conditions. Now
            you must learn to use the B-25 as a weapon, for that is the ultimate purpose of military
            flying.</p>
        <p>All the skill and determination you can bring to this job will be none too much. How well
            you learn to punish the enemy and to protect yourself will in the final analysis
            determine whether you are a successful pilot.</p>
        <p>The B-25 has been used for every purpose that need has demanded. Bombing, strafing,
            torpedoing, and even the evacuation of wounded, are listed in her duty roster. Whatever
            the need, the B-25 was either ready or quickly converted to do the job.</p>
        <p>Her primary duties have been many:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bombing, both low and medium altitude.</li>
            <li>Strafing, with cannon and machine gun.</li>
            <li>Smoke missions.</li>
            <li>Gunnery, both for defensive and offensive fire.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following pages illustrate the duties and responsibilities which are yours when using
            the B-25 as a weapon. They are typical of the actual orders and instructions issued to
            B-25 crews in training for combat duty.</p>

            <title>Preparing for Your Mission</title>
            <p>Before a mission is undertaken, the entire crew will be briefed. Upon completion of
                the mission the entire crew will again report to the S-2 officer for
                interrogation.</p>
            <p>As commander of your airplane, it is your duty to brief your crew before the flight,
                pointing out to each crew member the specific duties he is expected to perform.</p>
