        <p>Size up the man who is to be your engineer.</p>

        <p>Size up the man who is to be your engineer. This man should know more about the airplane
            you are to fly than any other member of the crew. If there are deficiencies in his
            training you may be able to fill them in.</p>
        <p>Think back on your own training. In many courses of instruction, you had a lot of things
            thrown at you from right and left. You had to concentrate on how to fly; where your
            equipment was concerned, you learned to rely more and more on the enlisted men,
            particularly the crew chief and the engineer, for advice.</p>
        <p>Pilot and engineer must work closely together to supplement and fill in the blank spaces
            in each other's education.</p>
        <p>To be a qualified combat engineer, a man must know his airplane, his engines, and his
            armament equipment thoroughly.</p>
        <p>He must work closely with the copilot, checking engine operation, fuel consumption, and
            the operation of all equipment.</p>
        <p>He must be able to work with the bombardier, and know how to cock, lock, and load the
            bomb racks. It is up to you to see that he is familiar with these duties and, if he is
            hazy concerning them, to have the bombardier give him special help and instruction.</p>
        <p>He should have a general knowledge of radio equipment, and be able to assist in tuning
            transmitters and receivers.</p>
        <p>While the flexible gunners do not require the same delicate touch as the turret gunner,
            they must have a fine sense of timing.</p>
        <p>All gunners should be familiar with the coverage area of all gun positions, and be
            prepared to bring the proper gun to bear on the target.</p>
        <p>They must be experts in aircraft identification.</p>
        <p>They must be thoroughly familiar with the machine guns. They should know how to maintain
            the guns, how to clear jams and stoppages, and how to harmonize the sights with the
            guns.</p>
        <p>During training flights, the gunners should be in their turrets, tracking with the guns
            even when actual firing is not practicable. Other aircraft flying in the vicinity offer
            excellent tracking targets, as do automobiles, houses, and other ground objects during
            low-altitude flights.</p>
        <p>Keep your gunners' interest alive at all times. Any form of competition among the gunners
            themselves should stimulate their interest.</p>
        <p>Finally, each gunner should fire the guns at each station to familiarize himself with the
            other positions.</p>
        <p>Your engineer should be your chief source of information about the airplane. He should
            know more about the equipment than any other member of the crew&#8212;yourself
            included.</p>
        <p>You, in turn, are his source of information about flying. Bear this in mind in all your
            discussions with the engineer. The more complete you can make his knowledge of the
            reasons behind every function of the equipment, the more valuable he will be as a member
            of the crew. Someday his extra knowledge may save the day in an emergency.</p>
        <p>Generally, in emergencies, the engineer is the man to whom you turn first. Build up his
            pride, his confidence, his knowledge. Know him personally; check on the extent of his
            knowledge. Make him a man upon whom you can rely.</p>
