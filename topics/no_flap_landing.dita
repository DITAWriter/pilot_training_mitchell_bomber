    <title>No-Flap Landing</title>
    <shortdesc>Occasionally both in combat and normal operations your plane may be damaged to the
        extent that flaps cannot be lowered for landing.</shortdesc>

            <p>The use of full flaps reduces your landing speed approximately 20 mph; therefore, a
                slightly different technique is required for landing when using no flaps.</p>
            <p>You must be familiar with this technique:</p>

        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>Add approximately 10 mph to your normal gliding speed.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Keep the plane's attitude almost level on the approach.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Use less elevator control and more power than normal in the roundout. (In some
                    instances, it may be necessary to use considerable power to decrease your rate
                    of descent.)</cmd>

                    <note><p>When making no-flap landings always land on the first few feet of the
                            runway. Your landing speed is greater and your landing roll much
                            longer.</p><p>Don't let the nosewheel touch the ground before or with
                            the main wheels.</p><image keyref="landing_no_flap"/></note>
